I also wanted to be able to share these posts, even though they are \\nold, with people interested in StomaStrap. Every ostomy has a backstory - These posts tell most of mine. \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e \\n\\nMy cancer hasn\'t been detectable in almost 3 years, which is great news. My overall health has been pretty good over the past year, so \\nI don\'t usually feel the need to update anyone via CaringBridge. Plus I know firsthand the immediate stress response of seeing a CaringBridge\\nupdate from a loved one pop into my email inbox. I don\'t like to cause any undue stress.\\n\\nOne thing that has really helped me through this health journey has been my approach to problem solving. Many of the problems I\'ve had to solve seemed\\nvery personal and applicable only to me. \\n\\nDuring my 14 months with multiple enterocutaneous fistulae and an open abdomen, I created a 3D printed brace for the Eakin wound bag that I wore. It was an basically a big ostomy bag with a drain. I needed a nurse to help me change it 2 times a week. Leaks were common. My life, already constrained by cancer and the inability to eat, shrunk even further.\\n\\nAfter I created the brace, life was better. I still remember that The Cars were on the sound system when I popped into a grocery store. Walking around in public without worrying that at any moment I\'d have to scurry back to the car, soaked in output? My eyes teared up near the produce aisle. That brace was just what I needed. \\n\\nDespite assurances from medical personnel that the brace was a great idea, no one asked me to make one for another patient. I tried to connect with numerous wound and ostomy professionals, and while there was some interest, to my knowledge no one has ever worn that wound bag brace but me. I\'ve got the design posted at https://www.printables.com/model/449956-wound-bag-brace - As far as I can tell, I\'m the only one who has ever worn one.\\n\\nIt\'s a fact of adult life - No one will advocate for you as strongly as you can for yourself. Being an adult means that you care for yourself. So if you\'ve somehow found yourself here, and think that the StomaStrap may help you - Maybe you\'re right. Show the product to your health care team and see if they think it\'ll work for you. Or just buy one and try it out. My goal is to find the people that it can help.\\n\\nThe StomaStrap uses many of the same design elements of the wound bag brace. It is focused on delivering down force on the adhesive part of the appliance. It consists of some 3D printed parts and a belt. I wear it every single day. It does seem like it might be a solution that applies to people other than me. \\n\\nMy initial efforts to just throw the wound bag brace out into the world have failed miserably. I\'m going to take a different approach with StomaStrap. It means I need to deal with a lot more moving parts (website, LLC, printing services, etc). The goal is to make it so that more people get a solution that works for them. \\n\\nAnyway, the rest of this section of the website is my personal blog, centered around my cancer diagnosis and recovery from the substantial surgical complications that resulted in my ostomy. Just in case you were interested in knowing more about me and where I\'m coming from. \\n\\n~Ed"},{"id":"mri-results-are-clean","metadata":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/mri-results-are-clean","source":"@site/edsBlog/2024-03-08-mri-results-are-clean.md","title":"MRI Results are Clean","description":"TLDR: The MRI results say there are no cancer metastases on my liver.","date":"2024-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":14.355,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ed Hubbell","title":"Engineer @ StomaStrap & GSDware","url":"https://github.com/edhubbell","page":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/authors/ed"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/edhubbell","github":"https://github.com/edhubbell"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/edhubbell.png","key":"ed"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"mri-results-are-clean","title":"MRI Results are Clean","authors":["ed"],"tags":[]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Starting StomaStrap","permalink":"/edsBlog/starting-stomastrap"},"nextItem":{"title":"Back Home","permalink":"/edsBlog/back-home"}},"content":"TLDR: The MRI results say there are no cancer metastases on my liver.\\n\\nSeriously, this post is way long. You can stop reading here if you want. I\u2019m still NED (no evidence of disease). The rest is so I don\u2019t forget. Or rather, so that I\u2019ll be able to remember after my mind covers the past week with layers of time, denial, and post traumatic amnesia.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e \\n\\nThe start of 2024 was not easy. The day after Christmas brought the gift that no one wants - Ureter stents.\\n\\nThey left one stent in (from one kidney to my bladder) after my operation in October. The stents only last for about 3 months before they need to be replaced, as they are plastic and therefore an infection risk. The folks in urology decided that due to radiation damage from cancer treatment a few years back, maybe I needed a stent on the other side as well. Plus that kidney looks a little plump. So I went in to get the old one out and have two new ones put in. Luckily, this is a procedure that doesn\u2019t involve making any new holes - They can use one I already have. Even more luckily, due to the small size and extreme sensitivity of that hole, they knock you out ahead of time. \\n\\nI meet the urology surgeon for the first time as they\u2019re prepping me for the procedure. He references a collection of fluid in my pelvis that was on the last CT scan. Mentions it with a bit of a shrug that clearly says \u2018not my fucking problem\u2019. Santa must have brought the doc socks.\\n\\nWe leave the hospital without any post-procedure follow up from urology. The next day consists of pissing razors. This side effect went unmentioned, despite being very much urology\u2019s fucking problem. Anesthesia calls to follow up and gets urology\u2019s earful. Urology, bitter about working on Boxing Day, never calls. \\n\\nEarly January\u2019s post holiday respite slides into mid-January\u2019s cold doldrums, typically the deepest of my year. My GI system isn\u2019t faring well. I can eat on some days. Other days I have endless intestinal gurgling. Loud transfers of liquid, seemingly directionless. No appetite. One x-ray shows a possible obstruction. Another x-ray a week later looks more definitive (not in a good way). A follow up CT at the end of January doesn\u2019t look great, and I\u2019m down to about 140lbs. My liquid diet isn\u2019t keeping any pounds on. Plus the fluid in the pelvis. So I\u2019m admitted to the hospital. \\n\\nI don\u2019t tell many folks I\u2019m going in - I\u2019m hoping for a quick stay. The first day brings my first experience getting an NG tube shoved up my nose and down my throat while conscious. This is unpleasant, but goes smoother than expected. Then a PICC line inserted the next day (my 5th), so they can give me IV nutrition. On the third day - Remember the fluid in my pelvis? The GI surgery team steps up to own it - So it\u2019s their problem. \\n\\nTo drain this pelvic fluid, you can\u2019t just jam a needle through anywhere. It\u2019s a pelvis. There\u2019s a lot that goes on down there - Pooping and peeing and reproducing and whatnot. As it turns out, the most direct way to this fluid deposit is from the back - Right through the top of my right butt cheek. You know that spot you rub when you have lower back/upper butt pain? That\u2019s where the needle goes. \\n\\nThey bring me down to the CT machine to have the procedure, heavily dosed with the hospital 3rd day prescription cocktail of sleep deprivation and stress. When nurses can\u2019t agree on where to put my TPN IV machine, I helpfully disconnect the TPN line myself and stop the pump. Now instead of two nurses quibbling with one another, there are three focused on admonishing me. \u2018You\u2019ve put your procedure at risk, what if your blood sugar drops, we can\u2019t connect that TPN again\u2019. This all sounds like excuses to me - I was on TPN for 14 months with no blood sugar issues on disconnect. You want to keep a CT machine and a doctor idle, that\u2019s on you. A waiting period of ten minutes provides sufficient time to brew my shame. The doctor arrives and I apologize for my actions. I\u2019m obviously not thinking straight. They\u2019re understanding and kind. I\u2019m also nervous about this CT scan guided procedure they\u2019re about to attempt. There are no warnings, and I\u2019ve done no research..\\n\\nAdministered not nearly enough Versed and fentanyl for what\u2019s to follow. While laying on my left side, I can\u2019t see what I perceive to be a 16-penny nail as it is slowly driven through my upper butt cheek and into my pelvis. Intermittent images are taken on the CT to make sure the nail goes to the correct location and to lengthen the entire procedure. Prior to now, Versed has left me feeling ambivalent and even forgetful during procedures. It\u2019s outmatched here, and it isn\u2019t close. They say the nail is a plastic tube, but I know what a nail feels like.\\n\\nPost procedure, wheeled back to my room, inconsolable. On my side, crying like I\u2019m 7 years old, for an hour. Headphones in, blasting Japandroids, ignoring all nursing staff. Then some morphine. The pelvic pain is so bad, all urinary control is gone. Pee leaks out of me with no notice. This feels very much like a permanent condition. It continues this way until morning, when the nurse\u2019s aid can\u2019t understand how my desire to stay warm is outweighing any concerns about wet bedding and bedwetting.\\n\\nLuckily, urinary control returns a few hours before urology arrives and tells me not to worry. The new drain is doing its thing. The next few days - island getaway, Mardi Gras and Super Bowl parties - All missed. My obstruction clears, and I\u2019m allowed to eat again. Note that there\u2019s no object that was obstructing - It\u2019s just that my intestines and their associated scar tissue got in a bad spot. My drain fluid tests positive for MRSA. Folks start showing up in yellow gowns, but I\u2019m told it isn\u2019t a big deal. Sent home after 8 days with a drain hanging out of my upper butt cheek and 10 days worth of antibiotics.\\n\\nOver the next few weeks I try to figure out what I can eat without causing the symptoms of a blockage again. Pizza? No - 2 days of gurgle after only 2-\xbd pieces. Noodles with beef and sour cream? Nope. Gut probably has nothing left to digest dairy after days of IV and oral antibiotics. Pho? Winner. Pho almost every day (including today). I\u2019ve tried 6 different places. Tip: There\u2019s a robot server and lots of meat at Pho 919 in Cary. \\n\\nLeap day closes out February, and it\u2019s been one month since my last CT. One nice side effect of all these extra CT scans is that I\u2019m not nervous about them spotting a cancer recurrence. I even mention this at lunch with a friend before my CT. No big deal, just had one a month ago. Get my CT, and head off to grocery shop. My phone dings while I\u2019m in the Compare looking for coconut cream for pina coladas and painkillers - There\u2019s a fresh pineapple at home, and the new blender blades seem up to the task of turning ice into slush. It\u2019s the CT results, but I\u2019ll check them when I get in the car. I forget and don\u2019t even look until I get home. \\n\\nI\u2019ll just paste some radiology reports here:\\n\\n \\n- Liver: There is a new 1.0 cm lesion within hepatic segment IVb on series\\n\\n3 image 45. There is a new 1.1 cm lesion within segment 8 (3/31).\\n\\n\\nAnd \\n\\n\\nImpression:\\n\\n1. New hepatic lesions, suspicious for metastatic disease. Recommend MRI\\n\\nabdomen with and without contrast for further evaluation.\\n\\n \\nThis is not good. The most common site for colorectal cancer to migrate to is the liver. Once cancer leaves the original location, the complexity of treatment goes up, and the effectiveness goes down. There are still treatments with curative intent, but it\u2019s a hard road that no one wants to be on.\\n\\nThe next few days are difficult. I tell a few people with intimate experience with cancer what\u2019s up. Avoid telling family until the weekend. Duke schedules the MRI for April 4th, a 32 day wait that would, in less dire circumstances, be laughable.\\n\\nOne bright spot - I\u2019m a member of a private Facebook group called Colontown that acts as a support system for colorectal cancer patients and caregivers. The moderator of the LiverLovers sub-group says they are here to help me. Sure, whatever, help me cope, fine. Betsy wants to know where I live and where I\u2019m being treated. Upon hearing Duke, she says I want Dr. Lidsky. And she\u2019s going to text him now. At 8:30PM. A person I\u2019ve never met, who from what I can tell doesn\u2019t even work for a medical facility, is connecting me to the correct liver surgeon at Duke. Over Facebook. I haven\u2019t gotten a call or message from anyone at Duke, but a stranger who\u2019ll never see a co-pay is somehow coordinating my care more effectively than I\u2019ve ever experienced.\\n\\nMy GI surgeon\u2019s assistant calls at mid-day on Friday, and says that evidently \u2018someone already has you set up with Dr. Lidsky\u2019s team\u2019. In the days after bad test results, there are few sources of comfort. Having a plan is one. Betsy was not only offering encouragement - She helped to implement a plan. I\u2019m still blown away. You can donate to their nonprofit at https://paltown.org/\\n\\nMy oncologist messages me Friday night, and he\u2019s \u2018also very concerned with these scan results\u2019. We need to biopsy one of the liver spots. A liver MRI would also be helpful. \\n\\nMonday comes, and we\u2019re looking at outside MRI providers. Ask Duke for a referral, but the liver doc prefers internal scans. They move the MRI to the following Tuesday, 3/12. Barely acceptable, but enough for me to stop fantasizing about picketing Duke Hospital with a sign that says \u2018Cancer MRI Wait Time: 32 Days  DukeIsBroken.org\u2019.\\n\\nWednesday brings an appointment to have the drain pulled from my buttocks. It\u2019s not last on my list of priorities, but it\u2019s not near the top. I\u2019m still adjusting to what the next few months will look like. The most likely scenario is some kind of systemic chemo, followed by liver surgery. Not sure if the lesions shown on CT are resectable or not. Maybe an implantable hockey-puck sized chemo pump that delivers straight to the liver is on the table.\\n\\nThere\u2019s some footage of a person in the surf as the 2004 tsunami hits Thailand. He\u2019s just looking at the wave coming toward him. It\u2019s haunting, watching him not turn to seek safety. That\u2019s how it felt, looking at the treatments ahead. Nowhere to run, and no ability to conceive what was to come, apart from knowing it was more than I could bear.\\n\\nSo Wednesday morning arrives, and I don\u2019t have any real work to do nor the mind to do it. With Karen\u2019s blessing, I head over to Duke Radiology and proceed to treat them like a barber shop. Any chance for a no-show? I\u2019m looking for a walk-in MRI. The person at the desk offers me the scheduler\u2019s phone number. I give them a call and explain what I\u2019m looking for. They put me on hold for five minutes. \u2018Are you there now?\u2019 \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m standing right outside the waiting room.\u2019 \u2018Hold on Mr. Hubbell, I\u2019m working on it.\u2019 I\u2019m starting to think maybe this is going to work out. Sure enough, she gets back on the line and has me scheduled for 10:30AM at the Cancer Center, a 5 minute walk from where I\u2019m standing. \\n\\nGet stuck a couple of times for one IV, and I\u2019m in the machine by 11. Out by 11:30. By now, Karen has used her doctor powers to call the radiology reading room. They say they\u2019ll move my MRI to the top of the stack. We\u2019re thinking it\u2019ll take maybe an hour. So we wait. I come home for lunch, and Karen takes me over to the appointment to remove the drain. The GI team is behind  schedule (as is their custom), so we don\u2019t see the GI surgeon until about 3PM for a 1:30PM appointment. Still no MRI results. \\n\\nKaren\u2019s pulling for something fungal. Maybe the MRSA that was found in the drain fluid did something strange to the liver. Dr. Migaly, the GI surgeon, mentions possibly the contrast used was at some in-between phase. He also mentions that he found the CT results shocking. That said, the mood in the room is not hopeful. I\u2019m trying to not lose focus on what\u2019s likely ahead of me. But the longer the read takes, the more hope creeps in. Maybe it\u2019s taking so long because they can\u2019t square the MRI results with the CT. Maybe.\\n\\nDrain pulled, we head home. Henry has a basketball award \u2018banquet\u2019 (aside from post-assembly cupcakes, there is no food). After that, we\u2019ve got reservations at M Sushi. It\u2019s an attempt to make some positive memories before I\u2019m back on chemo and raw fish goes off-menu.\\n\\nSitting in the chairs above the basketball court with the rest of the parents. There\u2019s plenty of seating, so everyone is spaced out. Navy painted seats that fold up. They were once red. I\u2019m in the last row on the corner, languidly clapping for whatever team award is announced. I know precisely 1 kid in this gym. I don\u2019t know what team was up when my phone received an incoming MyChart message from my oncologist. This is what it said: \\n \\n\\nDear Ed--\\n\\nHere is the text of the MRI report (not released yet):\\n\\nNo mass to correlate with the previously indexed hypointensities seen on recent CT. These areas are favored to reflect areas of hepatocyte injury or inflammation, rather than metastatic disease. Redemonstrated benign hepatic hemangiomas, not significantly changed since 2021.\\n\\nThis result from the MRI combined with your negative Signatera in January do not support a diagnosis of recurrent/ metastatic disease.\\n\\nI look forward to Dr Lidsky\'s review of the scan, but at this point there is no evidence of recurrent/ metastatic disease.\\n\\nBest - John Strickler\\n\\n \\n\\nThere are parents of athletes at my kid\u2019s school who are likely still wondering why the guy in the upper corner seat was weeping. Then texting, then more weeping. \\n\\nKaren is cc\u2019d on all my MyChart messages. I texted her @5:58PM - \u2018Read that message.\u2019 Her reply - \u2018Best message ever.\u2019 No energy left for exclamation.\\n\\nI allowed myself (and my shape-shifting liver) a half a beer at dinner, which went from a wake to a full celebration. We all had the nigiri omakase dinner, and it was outstanding. The rest of the night was spent trying to get the good news to folks who had earlier heard the bad news.\\n\\nOn Thursday 3/7, I got a call from Dr. Lidsky. I immediately thanked him, while also expressing my desire not to need to meet him in person. He affirmed radiology\u2019s read of the MRI, and suggested that he didn\u2019t need to waste my time with an in-person appointment. My time? It\u2019s your time that I don\u2019t want to waste. And I thanked him for working so closely with Colontown, and how much of a comfort that was to have a plan in the first 24 hours.\\n\\nNow I\u2019m left struggling to find a balance. Facing life\u2019s fragility gives a perspective that prioritizes living in the moment, but the weight of that perspective is a tough daily lift. A friend shared a saying that gives some insight - \u2018You can\u2019t mow tomorrow\u2019s grass today\u2019. It\u2019s a fight to remember and recall suffering from the past and the perspective in that moment. There\u2019s an instinct to put this all behind me, to move on. \\n\\nI\u2019ve been to a warzone, but as a journalist or a tourist? I don\u2019t want to go back, and I won\u2019t dare presume to tell what lessons to draw from the experience. That makes me feel like a tourist. With a dash of denial, I get to leave it behind. But I\u2019m trying to write it down, to learn something, to live differently. To be a better friend to those in the warzone. To face life, and death, with intention, maybe?\\n\\nYou\u2019ve read this far, which makes you a friend. \\n\\nIf this was news to you, I\u2019m glad that you didn\u2019t get the full immersion experience. Folks that happened to text me got the news, as I\u2019m pretty shit at keeping mum. Making the call or text that says \u2018CT scan says lesions on my liver\u2019 is exhausting. I\u2019m hoping to never do it again.\\n\\nIf this wasn\u2019t news, thanks for the support over the past week. Know that you\u2019re loved, appreciated, and trusted.\\n\\nAnd to Karen - You\u2019re the best partner I could hope for. Hoping for better days ahead.\\n\\nEnjoy your time with friends and family. Hug someone. \\n\\n~Ed"},{"id":"back-home","metadata":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/back-home","source":"@site/edsBlog/2023-10-13-back-home.md","title":"Back Home","description":"Straight to the lede - I\'m home!

I know everyone wants to know what I chose to have first after not eating for 14 months. I didn\'t choose - I was in the hospital. They brought two small turkey sausages to my room, and I ate one of them. Wasn\'t really hungry, as they still had me on TPN overnight. It could be said that it was the most delicious turkey sausage I\'ve ever had. It could also be said it\'s in a tie with every other turkey sausage I\'ve ever had.\\n\\nNo, no, no - I will not turn this journal into a Seinfeldian rant on the qualities (and lack thereof) of hospital food. I respect you all too much for that. Plus my breakfast sandwich this morning was really quite good. Sadly, somewhere on a tray at this very instant is a BBQ sandwich that will never find its host - I was released prior to lunch.\\n\\nThe best part of the food really was the chance to interact with the folks that deliver it in a non-adversarial  way. You knocked to come get a tray? Well, here\'s the tray! Happy transaction on both sides. Over fifty hospital days in the past 2 years, and I had about 8 trays of food total. \\n\\nI\'m on no painkillers at all since my episodes of Dilaudid-fueled nightmares. The pain I feel in my abdomen at the moment is akin to the pain of a gentle sunburn, reminding you of vacation. Although maintaining a healthy fear of sneezing or coughing is still critical.\\n\\nHearing about the lack of painkillers, one of the doctors suggested that I was tough. I\'ll admit to being stubborn. It could just be that compared to the past 14 months, the pain I\'m feeling now is nothing. Pain gets graded on a curve. Someone tough could watch as that last IV is removed from the back of their hand. I averted my eyes. \\n\\nSo I\'m allowed to eat what I want, but also must jam down 3 protein shakes a day to keep the healing going. \\n\\nAlso, I poop into a bag on my abdomen now. Readers will have to request details if their interests intersect with this subject. It\'s not that I\'m hesitant to share. But as with hospital food humor, I respect both you and myself too much for poop tales. A journal is no place for shit stories. In-person is better for that kind of thing.\\n\\nSo I have a couple of appointments for follow-up next week to have drains taken out. About 6 weeks of 10lb weight restriction. And I gotta learn how to manage this ostomy. Go back to Duke for cancer scans every 6 months. Train to get back in shape, and try to get back out on the soccer pitch/basketball court sometime in 2024. No making up for lost time, but try to live so that less time is lost. Travel. Dine. Stay out until 1AM. Take my wife on dates.\\n\\nWhich means that hopefully, this journal is drawing to a close. I won\'t say that this is my last entry, but I\'d not be disappointed if it were. \\n\\nThanks to y\'all for reading and following along. I have avoided chattering too much in the comments, as I didn\'t want to turn this into a back-and-forth. I\'m happy to have conversations with any of you. Just not all at once. While the journal text will be compiled into the future best seller \'Living with Enteroatmospheric Fistulae - An Owners Manual\', journal comments will not be included. It\'s an editorial decision by the Random House team.\\n\\nBut I have and will read every comment, and each one makes me approximately 19.28% happier. Not quite what CaringBridge would have you believe, but not shabby by any means. I appreciate your courage in exposing yourself to the painful parts of this story, and your willingness to laugh at the funny parts. Keep room for both, as there\'s often little (if any) distance between. \\n\\nMy love to you all - \\n~Ed\\n\\nPS - Yes I\'m quite likely going to go eat some Hutchins Garage pizza this weekend."},{"id":"rough-night","metadata":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/rough-night","source":"@site/edsBlog/2023-10-09-rough-night.md","title":"Rough Night","description":"Last night was rough.

Dark-night-of-the-soul rough. Couldn\u2019t get any sleep, not a moment lost. Just pain and discomfort interspersed with dementia-level personal crisis. I can\u2019t explain why a live track by singer-songwriter Slaid Cleves being rendered as an .exe file ever once constituted an emergency. This thought occurred to me at least 3 times.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e \\n\\nThe vivid nightmare of not being able to walk when chasing the abductors of my children had something to do with reading about events in Israel, combined with my literal failure to walk earlier in the day. That specific nightmare was theatrically well shot. The one about a super high forklift with controls linked to hand position was just your average height scare dreamscape.\\n\\nBlame the PCA, which is the acronym for patient-controlled analgesia \u2013 A locked box with a little green button attached to my IV pole. The locked box is full of narcotics. If you\u2019ve got a PCA on your pole, you can\u2019t leave the floor you\u2019re on. The button is only for you, and you can hit it as often as you like.\\n\\nI was trying to hit it about once an hour, but after not sleeping at all, you get a little punchy/pressy. I had nightmares the night before, but they were a little more mild - I\u2019m flying thru my childhood neighborhood as some all powerful bringer of death \u2013 It was clearly a dream, but \u2018we\u2019re sleeping \u2013 let\u2019s see how this plays out.\\n\\nAll of this to say \u2013 I wish my epidural had kept working, and I\u2019m on the Dilaudid no-fly list. Not pressing the button anymore.\\n\\nThe other issue was that I\u2019d already had a tough day before. On my second walk of the day, I set out to do 2 laps of the wing. Didn\u2019t make it past a half lap before my teeth started to chatter. Then my legs started to shake. Full body shakes, without the usual cold feeling that comes with them. Total failure, followed by 4 hours of restlessness in bed.\\n\\nThe reason I need to walk is because walking is the only thing that\u2019s shown to wake up the bowel function. I don\u2019t get to eat or drink or get this damn NG tube out of my nose and down my throat until my bowels start to function. So I\u2019m plenty motivated.\\n\\nDuring the operation, they took out all of my small bowel (as in removed it from my body cavity) and detached it from itself. They cut out the parts with the fistulas in it and made 3 connections (anastomoses), leaving me with 200cm of small bowel (all of which it is best not to imagine). So we need to make sure that the digestive system they stuffed back in me is actually working at the end before we cram anything in at the start.  \\n\\nInto this scene of despair comes Karen. I\u2019m going to skip the paragraphs I could write about how Karen makes me feel, because it\u2019s another story that I get to read and write every day. She comes in with a little dance to cheer me up and get me on a walk, but I need to cry some first. That accomplished, we head out to do a couple laps. Then a rest, then 2 laps more.\\n\\nShe\u2019s got to leave, and I\u2019m left with my sullen empty ostomy bag. But my mood is much improved, and they brought me a pint of blood for my troubles.\\n\\nI woke from a nap to a gurgle of activity \u2013 The stoma awakens! After 14 months of inactivity, finally some progress! And again, another 250ml a few hours later!\\n\\nAnd that\u2019s where things stand. Hopefully tomorrow they get this NG tube out of my face and let me start on some clear liquids. I\u2019ve been talking about an orange Gatorade for about a year, and even hot tea sounds like a treat.\\n\\nLast, I\u2019ll share a photo of my sewn up abdomen. It\u2019ll make for a cool looking scar.

In medicine as in military - When words are too wordy, make an acronym. So there is \u2018NPO\u2019. Stands for \u2018nothing by mouth\u2019, but in Latin or Greek. The whole of the hospital, including the meal delivery staff, knows the translation - From acronym, to ancient tongue, and to English.\\n\\nStill, six times a day, the knocks come. Each mealtime, an echo \u2013 An initial attempt; A return to retrieve a delivery denied.  \\n\\nThey\u2019re almost always friendly, and I\u2019m almost always so in return. Unless I was asleep, in which case I tend to be curt.\\n\\nEvents came to a head of sorts yesterday evening. Nearing 70 hours without a continuous hour of sleep, I took a walk and asked for a dry erase marker from the phone addled floor desk attendant. \u2018NO FOOD NO TRAY\u2019 in transparent blue ink onto my window. My nurse was not pleased, and erased it immediately, promising to do things properly.\\n\\nI strode about the hall, pushing an IV tower arrayed with the pelts of 8 bags, silently vowing to fall down before yielding. At last, an 8\xbd x 11 sheet onto the window \u2013 \u2018NPO (except for meds)\u2019.   \\n\\nYet again this morning, the knock comes \u2013 \u2018You NPO?\u2019\\n\\nIn any case, I did get 3 successive hours of sleep last night. My mood is much improved. I feel OK, and the infection (which is some gut bacteria, lost and running around in my blood) seems to be knocked back. It\u2019s a Sunday, and no one really checks out of the hospital on a Sunday. At least not voluntarily. In that context, waiting seems preferable.   \\n\\nNext steps are to get a new PICC line (IV line that I get nutrition thru). Once the folks up at vascular access on the 9th floor see fit to do that, I\u2019m halfway home. They\u2019ve cultured my blood and figured out which antibiotic is working. That will let them move me from a Long Island iced tea of antibiotics down to a more reasonable shot of Stoli. If all goes right, home early this week with either oral or IV antibiotics.\\n\\nThen it\u2019s all about getting surgery rescheduled. The GI side of the surgical team stopped by today - some of them twice. They were optimistic about getting me back on the schedule and promoting me to favorite ex-patient. We\u2019ll hopefully hear more from Plastics on Monday.\\n\\nThese health issues have proven difficult for me to put into a larger context. I often get the sense I\u2019m not learning the lesson I\u2019m supposed to. This latest episode is yet another bullet item on a long list.\\n\\nSome look to philosophy for comfort, perhaps from the Stoics. Or religion - One of my caregivers shared his love for Paul\u2019s letters in Ephesians. Not ashamed to say I find comfort in words from what are surely the fables of our present age \u2013 Season 2, episode 22.\\n\\nLisa: Perhaps there is no moral to this story.\\n\\nHomer: Exactly!

I\u2019ve been anxious about getting a date for this surgery. It\u2019s nice to see some kind of finish line.\\n\\nThe surgery is a dual-specialty all day long affair. I\u2019ll be asleep, so I won\u2019t care.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e \\n\\nFirst, Dr. John Migaly will be doing the GI stuff, which is the hard part. He\u2019s got to find each hole in my small intestine (and there are at least 4). He\u2019ll then cut a little before the hole and a little after the hole and join the cut sections together. This joint is called an anastomosis. In theory, he\u2019ll have to do that 4 times. In practice, could be between 2 and 6. After restoring continuity to my small bowel, he\u2019s got to stuff what\u2019s left back in my abdomen in a way such that it doesn\u2019t kink over on itself.\\n\\nThis part of the surgery is dicey - Teasing out the small bowel tissue from the abdomen is made difficult by the scar tissue left over from the previous operations. The reason this surgery needed to wait for a year is because we need that time to allow the scar tissue around the bowel to dissipate. Waiting for a year increases the odds of a successful result on the first try.  \\n\\nOnce that\u2019s done, Dr. Ash Patel from plastics gets a go at me. His job is to seal up my abdomen so it looks less like the medical curiosity that it has been for the last year. Getting my stomach muscles to meet again will require implanting a mesh that will dissolve over time. I\u2019ve been assured that all of this is the easy part. Whether or not I\u2019ll have a bellybutton anymore is an open question - My ambivalence on the matter is boundless. Presence/absence of navel is not on my list of success metrics. I\u2019d be more interested in being able to do a sit-up sometime in 2024.       \\n\\nThe last estimate I got for the hospital stay was 5 to 10 days. Pulled a 40 day bid last time. Five to ten? I can that kind of time standing up. Especially if I get to eat during part of it.\\n\\nLikely to be on a clear liquid diet for at least the first few days in the hospital. Not sure on the timing of when I\u2019ll get to eat real food.\\n\\nSo, that\u2019s the update. The next 5 weeks are full of medical appointments, a quick beach trip, and kid camp transport. Plus wrapping up some work projects that need my attention. Hoping to neither relay nor relate any additional news until after the surgery.\\n\\n~Ed"},{"id":"april-update","metadata":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/april-update","source":"@site/edsBlog/2023-04-18-april-update.md","title":"April Update","description":"It\u2019s been a while since the last update.","date":"2023-04-18T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":9.275,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ed Hubbell","title":"Engineer @ StomaStrap & GSDware","url":"https://github.com/edhubbell","page":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/authors/ed"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/edhubbell","github":"https://github.com/edhubbell"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/edhubbell.png","key":"ed"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"april-update","title":"April Update","authors":["ed"],"tags":[]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Surgery Date","permalink":"/edsBlog/surgery-date"},"nextItem":{"title":"Good Bad","permalink":"/edsBlog/good-bad"}},"content":"It\u2019s been a while since the last update. \\n\\nIf you\u2019re reading this, I\u2019m already wearing sweatpants or shorts. Unless I\u2019m in bed or showering. My t-shirt is either the one I slept in last night, or the one I\u2019ll sleep in tonight. Solid chance that it\u2019s both. Socks are likely pulling another multi-day shift. Disposable hospital underwear, loose elastic waistband. \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e \\n\\nSweatpants are my uniform due to the dressing over the fistula. The bag extends down to my waistline. Pants that interfere with that interface cause the dressing to fail faster. Days when the dressing fails are not good. Sweatpants and athletic shorts are loose enough to not cause issues. \\n\\nConnection between the PICC line in my left arm to the TPN pump happens at around 8PM each evening. It takes 12 hours to pump the 2.8 liters of nutrition into my veins. Can\u2019t change a shirt while the pump is connected, as the sleeve can\u2019t get past the PICC. TPN connection time marks the end of the productive portion of my day. \\n\\nUntil very recently, most of my waking hours consisted of moving very cautiously so as to not disturb the wound bag on my stomach. The bags were wearing out after about 2-1/2 days. \u2018Wearing out\u2019 means that the stomach acid from my fistula soaks against my skin. This hurts the skin. It also eats away at the bag until the stomach acid starts to escape at the seams. Once that starts, there\u2019s no patching the dressing - You need a whole new bag change. That takes 2 people about an hour. \\n\\nKaren had been nice enough to help me change the dressing on the weekends so I could make it to Tuesdays and Fridays (when my home health nurse Keely visits). The dressing change routine wasn\u2019t getting any easier. Reaching out to wound nurses at Duke. On YouTube. Over Facebook. All were sympathetic and tried to help. Keely was keen to allow for some experimentation. We did find some products (especially 3M Cavillon Advanced Skin Care) that helped. Still, dressing lifetime and skin condition continued to deteriorate through Jan/Feb/March. Karen often returned home to find me in my easy chair, trying to minimize movement so the dressing could make it one more day. \\n\\nThe engineer in me made some attempts at working out some kind of solution. Tried some 3d printed shields that went inside the bag to guide the fistula output. Printed with a flexible plastic. Looked like a large plastic spider. Completely ineffective. \\n\\nThen I gave a try with an ostomy belt from Amazon combined with a 3D printed brace. Some success! Replaced the flimsy stretch belt with a solid canvas D-ring belt and a brace with vertical supports. Feels good - Lots of support through my open abdomen. How well does it work?\\n\\nI went from sitting still to playing Henry one-on-one basketball. He beats me, but at least I\u2019m out of the house. No more leaks, and Keely says my skin looks better than it ever has. My quality of life has doubled. Granted, it is still low - But it is 2x of what it was just a month ago. \\n\\nYou can take a look at what the brace looks like here: https://www.printables.com/model/449956-wound-bag-brace - Be warned that if you click around enough on that page, you\u2019ll find a photo of the brace on my abdomen. \\n\\nHere\u2019s where people tell me I need to patent the brace. Unlikely. There are probably about 30 people in the US who need a brace like this, and they each only need one. It\u2019s $3 worth of plastic. I\u2019ve let some ostomy nurses know about how effective it is. Hopefully we can get one to someone else who needs one. \\n\\n \\n\\nSurgery?\\n\\nSurgery to fix the fistula is slated for August. The reason for the delay is that we need to wait for the scar tissue on the small bowel to relax somewhat. The fistula takedown surgery is already complex enough - Fighting scar tissue increases the odds of forming another fistula. Thus incurring another 1 year wait for additional surgery. Please no. \\n\\n \\n\\nThe takedown surgery - Imagine a coiled garden hose with holes in it.They\u2019ll uncoil the hose, figure out where the holes are, and cut-and-rejoin the locations with the holes. Each cut and rejoin is called an anastomosis. I asked the surgeon how many I\u2019ll need - \u2018Could be one, could be 6\u2019.\\n\\n \\n\\nIt\u2019s an all day surgery with at least a gi surgeron and a plastic surgeon. With recovery, it is a 5 to 10 day hospital stay. After a 40 day stay last year, 5 to 10 sounds like a spa visit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEating?\\n\\nI\u2019m allowed to eat, but it just comes out in the bag. I get no nutrition or calories from it. For a while I was trying to eat small amounts each day. This turns into a greater risk of leaks and more skin pain. Even went so far as to go out to dinner one night - Next morning, leaks. So no more dinners out for me. \\n\\n \\n\\nBack to chewing food and spitting it out (at home). I\u2019ll eat some chocolate and cheese, but that\u2019s about it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDrinking?\\n\\nI\u2019m allowed to drink \u2018for patient comfort\u2019. It comes out in the bag after about 15 minutes. Cold drinks come out cold. I do a lot of rinsing and spitting into the sink, attempting to trick my body. This doesn\u2019t work that well. \\n\\nExtraction of the pleasure of food without swallowing is possible. Ballpark 80% of the pleasure is in the taste. Drinking, tho - It requires swallowing. \\n\\nSome drinks eat away at the bag and the skin. So I\u2019m mostly back to just water. \\n\\n \\n\\nWhat about DRINKING?\\n\\nOh, yeah - Alcohol. Well, an occasional drink makes it in. I don\u2019t absorb much alcohol in the short time it\u2019s in my system. I\u2019ve yet to stumble upon a drinking contest. I\u2019d need to be in the bathroom every 3rd shot anyway. Haven\u2019t caught a buzz from alcohol this year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCannabis?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScans\\\\Prognosis?\\n\\nMy oncologist left Duke at the end of 2022. Duke neglected to assign me a new one, and I neglected to follow up. This finally came to a head when insurance refused to pay for my January Signatera test (an expensive analysis that looks for my tumor\u2019s DNA in my blood). \\n\\nFirst appointment with the new oncologist, and the thought occurs \u2018Well, at least I can\u2019t get any bad news today - This is just a formality\u2019. Then they say I\u2019m overdue for a CT scan, and pulls strings to get it scheduled for that very evening. Ask about chance of recurrence, and the 30% number he tells me is higher than I want to hear. \\n\\nA few hours later, my CEA reading comes back higher than expected at 3.1. CEA is a blood test that measures a blood chemical that\u2019s present when you\u2019ve got active colorectal cancer. My previous readings had all been less than 1.8 - Well below the 2.5 threshold for concern. Concerns abound.\\n\\nSo it\u2019s the CT table at 6PM. Initial scan. \u2018Inhale. Hold your breath.           Exhale\u2019. Contrast solution into my PICC line brings an uncomfortable full body warming sensation. Then the mild panic and arching of the back. Close eyes and breathe. If the CEA results were low I\u2019d be fine. They weren\u2019t and I\u2019m not.  \\n\\nCheck the poker faces of the techs after the scan. They were whistling as I left - Was that a tell? Did the scan look really bad? If I were a tech, I\u2019d have a whole routine to try and hide my dread if I saw a bad scan. I\u2019d probably whistle.\\n\\nThe scans are looking for tumors apart from my primary tumor, which was removed with my rectum. Colorectal cancer tends to spread to other sites - Most notably the liver and lungs, but plenty of other places as well. Once it spreads from the primary site, you\u2019re considered stage 4. Treatment devolves to more chemo and whack-a-mole surgical interventions. I know two people going through this. They\u2019re with us, reading this now. They\u2019ve both been here, and painfully far beyond.\\n\\nIt\u2019d take a really manipulative bastard to write all this and hit you with a bad ending here. What I want you to understand is the real panic of this time. This cancer is not in my head. Scans do not always come back clean. Nothing is for the best. None of this is fair. \\n\\nSlept poorly. Pathology results came back when I was in the shower - No evidence of metastasis. Shed some tears of relief when I got out of the shower.  \\n\\nThen just today, my Signatera results came back - No tumor DNA detected. \\n\\nSo those are my latest scan results - Good news for now. All I need to have happen is keep those results up for the next 2-\xbd years or so, and then my odds are really good that this specific cancer never returns. Every 6 months another CT scan, every 3 months another Signatera test.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLife?\\n\\nVisits from college (and beyond) friends Heather, Jim and Tanya (with Dale and progeny) have all been a welcome break from the monotony of healing. \\n\\nHeather took a big gamble in showing up for about 4 days after not having seen me in like 6 years. As it turns out, she\u2019s still her and I\u2019m still me, and we had no problems passing the time. Thanks to her husband Mike for letting her get away for a bit. \\n\\nGot out one night with most of the soccer crew. I\u2019ve missed playing soccer - Competition and play are low on my list of capabilities. I\u2019ve also missed the people I used to play with - They\u2019re each more to me than what they are on the soccer field. Usually I turn into a TPN pumpkin at 8PM, but I stayed out until 11. Which means I was hooked up to TPN until almost 11 the next day. Worth it. \\n\\nJed\u2019s murder mystery night party, adults only picnic, mid-day pool at Accordion with Chris V, early evening pool at Accordion with Alise/Lillian/Brandon, TMBG concerts, visits with friends I can\u2019t lunch with but they visit anyway - There are good memories wedged in with the monotony.\\n\\nFamily is good. Theo is competing in the annual Beaver Queen Pageant - Mark your calendars for June 3rd and come on out to Duke Park. This is one year I\u2019ll actually get to watch the pageant - Usually I\u2019m tending bar in my front yard. Henry is working on his jump shot and starting a growth spurt, plus playing the upright bass. Karen is the best, and she looks good being it. \\n\\nWorking with 2-3 clients at the moment. The wound bag brace makes it so I can actually go in to client sites more than once a week. Enough work to keep me from looking for more. \\n\\nMostly, just trying to get through each day. Caught between the knowledge that our time is limited and the desire to fast forward to life post-surgery."},{"id":"good-bad","metadata":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/good-bad","source":"@site/edsBlog/2022-11-10-good-bad.md","title":"Good Bad","description":"It\u2019s the ol\u2019 good news/bad news routine around here this week.

We all know the rules on what comes first. \\n\\nThe good news is that I\u2019m getting stronger and gaining weight - Almost up to 150lbs. Even though I\u2019ve only put on about 10 lbs since my release, it seems to be the 10 lbs that separates \u2018sickly\u2019 from \u2018ehh - probably a distance runner\u2019. \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e \\n\\nThe bad news is that I had an appointment with the surgeon this week. Here\u2019s the relevant part of the (2 hours late and 6 minutes in length) conversation, when I asked about when my body would be ready for the next operation: \\n\\n \\n\\nMe: Timeframe?\\n\\nDr: I\u2019m thinking summer. \\n\\nMe. That\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s hard to hear. \\n\\n \\n\\nStill trying to get over the shock of going without really eating for what will be just about a full year. Our expectations were more along the lines of January/February. He confirmed my assumption that the fistula was unlikely to heal on its own. He also said if the wound around it healed faster we could look at earlier dates. My next appt isn\u2019t until January. Maybe I can surprise him with a healed wound by then. If you\u2019ve got some Lourdes water, send it on over.\\n\\nStruggling to determine how to deal with my limitations. Some things I enjoy greatly are off the table - e.g soccer/basketball/cardio, motorcycle riding, eating out, international travel. Looks like it\u2019ll be late summer of 2023 before any of those become possible again.  \\n\\nOther things are do-able with restrictions or modifications. Going to a bar is possible, but I can\u2019t really drink more than a single drink or so, and my TPN schedule usually requires that I\u2019m home from 8PM to 8AM. \\n\\nI can eat whatever I want, as long as I spit it out. Mildly to solidly revolting, depending on food - So eating (among other things) is best left as a solo activity.\\n\\nLuckily, I\u2019ve a thousand hobbies. I can still work, cook, weld, sew, play guitar, write, fix stuff, audit the contents of the internet\u2026 Too many hobbies, really. Trying to evaluate if I have the initiative to take this time and apply some extra focus to one or two things. As it stands - No answer - Try again later.\\n\\nAnyway, that\u2019s the update. Looks like Kat and her late June guess is the only person with even an outside shot of winning the free pizza. \\n\\n\\n~Ed"},{"id":"pizza-game","metadata":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/pizza-game","source":"@site/edsBlog/2022-10-21-pizza-game.md","title":"Pizza Game","description":"Sorry for the lack of updates.

There\u2019s much to tell, but no breaking news of real import. Just doing my time. \\n\\n\\nI\u2019m still not able to eat. So here\u2019s a little game we can play - Put your guess in the comments on the day I\u2019ll first consume a pizza from Hutchins Garage again. Closest guess wins a pizza on me (airfare not included). People have asked me what the first thing I\u2019ll eat will be, and that\u2019s unfair because it\u2019ll be whatever my health allows me to eat once my intestine is repaired. Be assured I\u2019ll be eating a Hutchins pizza as soon as I\u2019m allowed. So get your guesses in. On to less playful topics. \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e \\n\\nSince discharge from the hospital in late August, life follows a dull routine here. All nutrition and fluids are via IV into a PICC line in my arm. This process takes about 12 hours. With few exceptions, I\u2019m in my room drawing the shades at 7:45PM, hooked up around 8, watching TV by 8:30, upstairs at 10:30. Then it\u2019s out of bed at 7:30AM, unhooked around 8AM. Rinse and repeat.\\n\\n\\nThe home health nurse comes 2x a week to change the bag around my open wound (warning: click at your own risk). Within the wound is at least one fistula, which is a hole in the small intestine. The fistula leaks fluid all day long into the wound bag. We initially had lots of issues with leaking wound bags, but seem to have that squared away in the past few weeks. I assist with the dressing removal and cleaning until looking at the wound becomes uncomfortable. \\n\\n\\nNote: Observing peristalsis in an exposed small intestine is fascinating. Observing peristalsis in your exposed small intestine is unnerving. \\n\\n\\nThe doctors on discharge had given me some false hope that the fistula might heal on its own. Some internet research revealed that healing rates for fistulas exposed to atmospheric pressure rarely heal - A rate of less than 10% was the only published figure I could find. How could it heal, really? There\u2019s fluid flowing through at all hours of the day. The cure for this issue is another operation, a resection where they can remove the hole and stitch the small intestine back together. Unfortunately, the guidelines state that a waiting period of at least 3 months after the initial surgery is required. It seems no one wanted to tell me in August I\u2019d likely be missing Thanksgiving dinner. And Christmas breakfast. And Boxing Day brunch. Really, the whole kit & kaboodle. \\n\\n\\nThe first few weeks back home were the hardest. At that time, a rinse and spit cup allowed me to at least taste some liquids. The kids got some food from a local taqueria and were good enough to grab me a big styrofoam cup of agua de jamaica, which tastes like Mexican Kool-Aid to me. It quickly became my drink of choice, although homemade and without the bracing level of sugar. Rinsing with sugar water several times a day is incompatible with dental health. The latest formulation involves dried hibiscus flowers from Compare and sugarless monk fruit extract - Tastes great.\\n\\n\\nFoodless and weakened, I was unhappy. Not depressed, but sad. My positive long term prognosis keeps me from saying I was depressed. My experience with depression is that the conflict between mood and state is the most frustrating aspect. Depression to me is hopelessness, even as things are OK. That\u2019s not my current state. I have hope, and things are very much not OK. I\u2019m sad, and with good reason.\\n\\n\\nAfter the first month, the surgeon messaged me to let me know I could consume liquids \u2018for patient comfort\u2019. This is also around the time I chewed up and spit out some lasagna. And then some homemade pasta with pork butt ragu. And then some Ben & Jerry\u2019s. \\n\\n\\nBased on my own research (not yet peer reviewed), one can extract ~80% of the pleasure of Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream without ever having swallowed it. My favorite flavor, Phish Food, is chocolate with marshmallow and caramel swirl. One evening I added some additional caramel, and then thought \u2018hmm - Maybe that\u2019s too much caramel\u2019. Incorrect. The truth is that excess hot caramel is perfectly pleasant to spit into a bowl.\\n\\n \\n\\nChewing and spitting out food has greatly improved my mental state. I\u2019m not happy by any means, but I\u2019m less sad. The internet is full of warnings that this practice carries the risk of warping my relationship with food. That warning was targeted to bulimics, but it rings true in my case as well. \\n\\n\\nThe effect is different depending on the food. Eat and spit out an entire Big Mac - You\u2019ll likely find a craving satisfied completely (and perhaps permanently). McDonald\u2019s cheeseburgers, on the other hand, store well in the fridge, run less than 2 bucks, and can bear a second inspection. Honey Smacks and milk were once a vacation-only treat. Now I can drink the milk at the bottom of the bowl. And then have another bowl. \\n\\n\\nSoon followed expanding interpretations of what constitutes a \u2018liquid for patient comfort\u2019. The initial reading of \u2018surely this can\u2019t mean a chocolate shake\u2019 quickly gave way to \u2018a Milky Way mini at body temperature qualifies\u2019. As does cotton candy, M&Ms, espresso with ice cream in it, a sip from a spouse\u2019s Manhattan\u2026\\n\\n\\nComfort is best judged by the patient, but is sadly not based on taste alone. The fistula isn\u2019t far down into my digestive tract. The cost of a cold drink is a cool drooling sensation from my abdomen 15 minutes later. The effluent starts to fill the bag, which means a trip to the bathroom for draining. It\u2019s a quick cycle. \\n\\n\\nThe short run of small bowel means there\u2019s also no significant caloric or nutritional intake. It\u2019d be nice to down some veggie smoothies or probiotic kimchi, but nothing\u2019s making it that far down the line. Nothing ever makes it to my actual ostomy (at the end of what remains of the large intestine). The TPN via IV has all the nutrition I need, they say. Which is fortunate, because it\u2019s all I\u2019m able to get. I\u2019d drink cream if it meant calories.   \\n\\n\\nI\u2019ve gained some weight since my release, but not much. Hovering at 141lbs at the moment. The lack of weight gain coupled with my physical condition largely takes exercise off the table. The TPN dosage is already maxed out - 2800ml a night. That\u2019s the only time my body takes in any hydration. Usually this means peeing 2 to 3 times a night. Usually after waking up.\\n\\n\\nThen there are the bag leaks. The bag adheres to the skin via a wax-like adhesive that starts to decay as the dressing ages. By the 3rd day, the bad is full of chunks of loose adhesive. We endured a run of 3 Fridays where a freshly applied bag was leaking by 5PM. I say \u2018we\u2019, because a leaky bag is a whole house emergency. With no nurse available to change the dressing at that hour, we turned to friends with enough nerve to give wound care a shot. Pre-bourbon may or may not have been involved - I honestly don\u2019t know.\\n\\n \\n\\nStabilization of my nursing situation greatly helped things. The first 3 weeks had at least 4 different nurses attempting to change the bag. One attempt took 2-\xbd hours, only to spring a leak a few hours later. Now I have the same nurse every time, and we\u2019ve done enough experimenting with pastes/creams/patterns that we have things down to a working process. \\n\\n\\nMy jobs: answer door, have hot water ready, take off the wound dressing, clean the wound a bit, stop wincing, cut adhesive for a patch at the top of the wound, cut and place ostomy bag. \\n\\n\\nThe nurse\u2019s jobs: clean the wound after I give up, powder and coat any irritated areas, cut and apply the new wound bag, nod at dull conversational attempts from the patient.\\n\\n\\nThe latest leaks have all been my fault. I did some reading on a process called topical oxygen therapy that is used to speed wound healing. It works like this: expose the wound to a pure O2 atmosphere for 90 minutes a day or so, and voila - Increased healing rate. You can google it, it\u2019s a thing, mostly for diabetic ulcers that won\u2019t heal. But it is mentioned for surgical wounds as well. My engineering brain requires that I optimize as many conditions as possible, especially if there is additional hardware required. So a Craigslist oxygen concentrator sits in our kitchen, along with 30 feet of tubing to allow me to take my air from my TV chair. \\n\\n\\nThe leaks of late have been thru the hole I punch in the bag after the nurse leaves. The oxygen needs to get into the bag somehow, so a hole or slit near the top of the bag is the easiest solution. Taping over the hole provides incomplete coverage. I\u2019ve come back from hole punching to cutting a small slit - This leaves an opening that reduces the exposure of the sealing tape to that which must be sealed in. \\n\\n\\nOther orderless thoughts: \\n\\n\\nThe sheer amount of material involved is daunting. Every IV hookup involves alcohol wipes, saline and heparin injections, needles and tubes, and ziploc bags large enough to store a human head. Plus there\u2019s the matter of fridge space when 2.8 liters x 7 is delivered every Wednesday. Boxes and boxes, every week. \\n\\n\\nSmall project of replacing our front door knob went well. Threw the included keys away, because the Smart Key system let me re-key the lock to my house keys. Days later, I installed the deadbolt as well. Only then did I recognize that those original keys were needed after all in order to re-key the deadbolt. Trash is bad enough to search. Trash full of regurgitated food? Not fun. I did find the keys, tho. Only the 2nd bag I searched. Finding them spared me a shame-filled visit to the excellent folks at Don Hill\u2019s Lock & Safe.\\n\\n\\nCompliments about me keeping my sense of humor are appreciated, but I don\u2019t feel like I had any options. I\u2019m not physically able to eat, and yet I still love food. Many years ago, Karen\u2019s sister tried to sell me with \u2018he\u2019s funny and he likes to cook\u2019. Still mostly accurate. I\u2019m still me.\\n\\n\\nHaven\u2019t tried much alcohol - Despite the \u2018liquids for patient comfort\u2019 option, I doubt bathing the wound in unabsorbed ethanol would be wise. Especially what with the pure oxygen bath I\u2019ve been giving things. A nearby candle could be the end of me.  \\n\\n\\nKaren and the kids have been very supportive, which I appreciate greatly. My condition has led to a glut of TV watching every evening, and they usually watch things I\u2019m interested in. Except \u2018The Amazing Race\u2019 - I\u2019m tired of that one.\\n\\n\\nI have no body fat, so I\u2019m often cold. The wound bag is low enough to interfere with my waistline. So it\u2019s all athletic shorts and sweatpants for me. The PICC line is on the inside of my arm, near the elbow - So short sleeve shirts are required. Luckily we have blankets. \\n\\n\\nWent to a couple of DPAC things - If I start my injection early, I can take a break during the performance and then start things back up when I get home. Father John Misty was the first show Karen and I went to - He was backed by 9 musicians, which was much more than I expected. The next weekend, neighbors gifted us some tickets to see Steve Martin and Martin Short, which was a lot of fun. They tour with Steep Canyon Rangers - The music bits were every bit as good as the comedy numbers. \\n\\n\\nSlightly conflicted at the waste of food that comes with my current consumption. I\u2019m hesitant to go buy a more expensive burger from a local joint when I\u2019m just going to spit it out - Hence the Mickey D\u2019s trips. For me, it comes down to the fact that tasting food makes me a bearable person to live with. Plus I ate that expired burrata that no one else was going to touch anyway. I earned these Honey Smacks. Thoughts of rejecting my sensualist ways for a more ascetic life outlook were short lived. \\n\\n\\nWorking a few hours a day is good for my sanity. Going after new work and new clients seems like a low priority given everything else on the docket. I\u2019m taking things as they come in, and that\u2019s enough to keep me busy. \\n\\n\\nI\u2019ll stop there. Readers, I hope all is well in your world. Don\u2019t forget to leave a pizzadate guess in the comments. ~Ed"},{"id":"release-date","metadata":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/release-date","source":"@site/edsBlog/2022-08-23-release-date.md","title":"Release Date","description":"Looking like I\'ll be released on Wednesday, 8/24.

That\'ll make it a full 40 days. Insert some joke about Noah\'s ark here. Maybe an Irish Rover\'s reference. \\n \\nI\'m still not able to eat or drink anything. They\'re just sending me home because I\'m in good enough health to take my TPN at home. Karen\'s been trained on how to administer it, and y\'all are witnesses if I end up dead because of some kind of \'bubble in the line\' accident. That said, most of that life insurance benefit would likely end up with my kids, so maybe just let her slide this once. Leave vengeance for our children or theirs.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e \\n\\nMy wound dressing is a big bag stuck to my belly, with a nozzle at the bottom so I can empty it. My medical team and I will be tracking the output from the wound. A marked decrease in output signals that the small bowel fistulas may have healed. We really want the small bowel fistulas to heal, as that would allow me to start on some clear liquids and eventually progress to solid foods again. \\n \\nIf the small bowel fistulas don\'t heal, then I just sit on TPN until they are ready to open me back up and try to address the fistulas. The problem with that is the amount of time I\'d have to wait beforehand. They\'d want to wait until the scar tissue around the bowel starts to soften up. The doctor the other day tossed around a figure like 4 months. That\'s a season, and not a length of time that gives me comfort. I don\'t want to spend 4+ months not eating. So we\'re trying to keep hope alive that the fistulas will actually start to heal without additional surgical intervention. It is a hopeful sign that the volume of my wound output has decreased over the past few days. \\n \\nAs a surprise, my brother Erron flew down from Vermont to visit today. He caught me on a good day for visiting - Not much happening from a procedure standpoint, so we had all day to talk. It was a really nice surprise and one I won\'t soon forget. \\n \\nAfter over a month, I\'m really going to not miss this place. There are some characters that I\'ll regret not seeing. \\n \\nThere\'s the doc who was assigned to stimulate some output - A quick joke about them \'fingering my ostomy\' allowed our relationship to devolve to the point they suggested I might enjoy the podcast \'My Dad Wrote a Porno\'. In a place with not a lot of laughs, they gave as good as they got. Very much appreciated.\\n \\nThen there were nurses. So many nurses. So many good nurses, really. I\'ve had a couple dry spells, but overall, the kindness and professionalism of the nursing staff have really helped make a difference in my stay. Even the one who ignored my pages for over an hour motivated me to go spite walk a mile. There won\'t be a nurse to chat with when I come in for clinic appointments over the next few months - I\'ll miss that.\\n \\nAnd the food tray folks... With their 3x a day room knock and entries to attempt to retrieve trays from a room that never saw one. The pain management team, with their useless vapid questions and wasted expertise. The housekeeping rep who would stop by daily to ask if I was satisfied with the housekeeping and oh I\'m sorry were you sleeping. Vital signs taken at 4AM - Vital indeed. And this very evening, the dementia patient a few doors down ceaselessly bleating \'help\'. I\'ll miss you all.\\n \\nOK, so that\'s about it. Hopefully home Wednesday, and try to get back into some kind of groove with work stuff on Thursday. First day back doesn\'t mean I get to lay around. I\'ve been laying around for over a month, and not by choice. Eager to fire up my brain to make sure it still spins for at least a few hours. \\n \\nI\'ll have home health nurses come out 3x a week to change the dressing on the wound and do whatever general maintenance needs to happen. I assume I\'ll have to go in to see some docs every once in a while. My short-term responsibility is just to track wound output and not eat or drink anything. Should be do-able. \\n \\nMuch like my gaping abdominal wound, I\'d imagine the output to this site will slow down in the next few weeks. Major changes like permission to drink a glass of something/anything/please I\'m so thirsty or the transition to solid food would warrant an entry. Anyone who drops off a plate of cookies or treats for me in the next few weeks will also likely get a write-up, but not a positive one. \\n \\nGlad this chapter is ending.

Far more important to get the bowels working. Can always circle around in a few months and do a hernia surgery if I\'m up for that. \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e \\n\\nSo the status now is that I have a huge open wound that is attached to a vacuum system. The point of the vacuum system is to suck out any liquid leaking from the bowels. Evidently there are 2 damaged areas that were likely nicked when I had the procedure to move the ostomy from right to left (the same surgery this wound is from). I\'m on complete bowel rest. They want nothing going thru there. The drier and less active that area is, the better chance it has to heal. If the fistulas refuse to heal, we\'ll get to play \'Operation!\' again.\\n \\nA few days ago, they were allowing me small sips of Gatorade. That pretty much stopped when they noticed pooling fluid at the wound site. Orange, sweet smelling fluid. It seems even the small amounts of Gatorade I was allowed was flowing into my stomach, into the small intestines, and thru the holes into the wound crater. \\n \\nSo no drinking for me. I get to swish and spit, which isn\'t the same but is better than nothing. Gatorade as mouthwash is better than mouthwash as mouthwash. \\n \\nIt\'s looking like they\'re trying to send me home with the open wound and some equipment for feeding me via IV. Karen and I are being trained on TPN (total parenteral nutrition) - It\'s a bag of fluid that one of my children called my \'cum bag\'. Save your criticism. Remotely parenting from a hospital bed is level 10 hard. Also, I thought it was at least a little funny. No turning back now.  \\n \\nWe\'ll be fully trained on the TPN by Monday. So possible mid-week release. I\'ll still be wildly limited in what I can do once I\'m home (likely still no food/drink for a few weeks). So it\'ll be difficult, but hopefully not \'sleep in this hospital\' difficult. \\n \\nMentally I\'m ready to leave this place. I don\'t find the TV interesting. It\'s hard to get into any books. I stare at the clock on the wall a lot. The minute hand moves every 15 seconds, which means it must have about 240 gear teeth on it. I have witnessed it NOT move on a few occasions. This may be observation error, or it may be a true clock defect. Frustrated to report that attempts to engage hospital administration in this matter continue to fall short. I may just have to take it apart on my own.\\n \\nThe good news that I can share (that I haven\'t really up until now) is that the pathology report from the removed tissue looks good. I had no positive lymph nodes, which is a big deal because cancer spread usually happens thru the lymphatic system. It\'s at least a hopeful sign that I won\'t have to deal with distant metastasis to other locations in the future. Again, not a lock. Not trying to jinx anything here. Just some data that falls on the side we\'d like it to fall on. \\n \\nThat\'s about all I have to say. Thanks all for reading - It makes it easier to not have the same conversation multiple times. It\'s also encouraging to read your responses. Just because I don\'t typically reply doesn\'t mean I\'m not reading each one. \\n\\n~Ed"},{"id":"rearrangements","metadata":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/rearrangements","source":"@site/edsBlog/2022-08-11-rearrangements.md","title":"Rearrangements","description":"Last Friday\'s procedure to re-arrange my bowels ended with me still having an open wound for a belly.

Tuesday morning brought the disappointing news that they weren\'t going to take any action until Wednesday. Wednesday came, and I got brought down to the OR. At this point, I hadn\'t left the bed since Friday, as the only things between me and disembowelment were gravity and a thin plastic bandage.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e \\n\\nThere was some hemming and hawing from the anesthesia crew about me seeming out of breath (I wasn\'t) or febrile (99.3 isn\'t that far from 98.6).

Left in pain overnight, I exploded on the AM rounding doctors. Yelling, light wailing, medium desperate tears. After addressing the painkiller issue, I\'m offered some of the mental health services. \'There\'s a guy I think who plays the ukulele\' To which I respond \'I don\'t need some jackass to come play the ukulele. I play ukulele. I AM that jackass.\' Laughs all around. \\n\\nBut seriously, don\'t cross this threshold, pain management team. You pulled that epidural and then left me to shake in pain, unable to procure even Tylenol. \\n\\nI missed this in the last update, but for a time my scrotal sac swelled so much as to subsume the shaft and testes completely. Think of a good sized grapefruit, with a nipple on it to pee from. Or maybe don\'t think of that. Aiming is via pelvis positioning. They did finally build me a sac sling a la Borat. Big elastic band over the neck, little satchel to tuck my junk into. The swelling has gone down and I don\'t need the sling anymore, but I insist on keeping it on my IV tree as a talisman.   \\n\\nThe latest cycle is that I wake up, try to eat some jello or broth, wait throughout the day thru intestinal pain, then maybe throw up because whatever it was I ate that day really didn\'t go anywhere. The day is filled with level 3-6 pain mostly. \\n\\nHad a couple days with no sleep, which left me a tired shambling dead-behind-the-eyes ghoul. Yet Karen still visited. \\n\\nThere is one alarm here that goes off in the key and cadence of U2\'s \'With or Without You\'. Hearing it makes me think \'With. Definitely With. You need help getting out of bed, room 3\'. Sorry if that ruins the song for anyone.\\n\\nHad a friend bring a guitar in. Not really in a ukulele playing mood. The next day they put a huge PICC line in my right arm to feed me thru. I played 3 minutes of guitar, and the PICC line alarm started going off. I\'m not getting much playing time in. \\n\\nEnsconced all the way in the back of my room, sleeping on the overnight guest bed. The guest bed has some firmness and support for my back. I do have a window next to me, so there is daylight. \\n\\nI went to basketball camp every summer as a kid. During games you could always go to the water fountain, but morning and lunch breaks were special. That\'s when they\'d wheel out a big drink cooler of orange gatorade, and we\'d all line up for icy cups. So for me, the taste of orange gatorade has unique thirst quenching abilities. \\n\\nAs it turns out, one of the nurses here is someone I used to play pickup basketball with at the Y in downtown Durham. I had shared with her the story of basketball camp and orange gatorade. Later that week, as soon I was cleared to consume liquids, she brought over a big jug of orange that she grabbed while at a convenience store. That was a really nice thing to do.\\n\\nNo estimates on how long it\'ll take for my gut to wake up. I\'m on the far side of normal for sure. Not everyone gets the Friday BOGO Surgery special. My OR time alone makes me an outlier. However, once the gut wakes up, they\'ll want to see me eat something, keep it down, and maybe poop it out. \\n\\nIt\'s really hard being here for so long. I\'m mentally on tilt for at least a few hours a day. Hoping the gut gets the message. Maybe tonight is the night. \\n\\n~Ed"},{"id":"jolly-rancher","metadata":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/jolly-rancher","source":"@site/edsBlog/2022-07-26-jolly-rancher.md","title":"Jolly Rancher Sweet Tea","description":"tldr: hopefully home by Saturday","date":"2022-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":6.565,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ed Hubbell","title":"Engineer @ StomaStrap & GSDware","url":"https://github.com/edhubbell","page":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/authors/ed"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/edhubbell","github":"https://github.com/edhubbell"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/edhubbell.png","key":"ed"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"jolly-rancher","title":"Jolly Rancher Sweet Tea","authors":["ed"],"tags":[]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"ETA = IDK","permalink":"/edsBlog/eta-idk"},"nextItem":{"title":"Where I Am","permalink":"/edsBlog/where-i-am"}},"content":"tldr: hopefully home by Saturday\\n\\nThey removed the NG tube from my nose to my stomach on Sunday night - Actually let me do the pulling.

Things like water and juice and maybe even someday (if you\'re good) hospital food.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e \\n\\nThen Monday was really hard. All the little pokes/prods/interruptions/procedures become overwhelming. We\'ve been waiting for days for my ostomy to produce some output so we can proceed to a clear liquid diet. Any kind of diet sounds good. Here\'s a consumption summary over the first 11 days of my stay: \\n\\n6 Jolly Ranchers\\n3 Werthers Original Caramel Hard Candies\\n4 popsicles, each more disgusting than the previous\\n1 teeny orange Gatorade (spread out over 36 hours, each iced sip treasured)\\n\\nThe docs want to run a CT scan to check to see if there are any abscesses or infections in my abdomen that need attention and could explain the delay in ostomy output. They\'ve spent the past 2 days filling me with fluid via IV to try and get my creatinine levels down. When those levels are low enough, they can use the contrast solution during the CT without fear of kidney injury. \\n\\nOn Monday, my creatinine levels are finally low enough at 1.0 to run the CT. All I have to do is please chug this liter of oral contrast solution in the next 60 minutes. \\n\\nI have been craving ice water for a week. With all the fluids in my body, that craving had subsided somewhat. I\'ve got no choice other than to start drinking. It tastes terrible. This is going to be a long hour. A nearby friend offers to stop in, and I think \'sure - that will be helpful to have someone there to cheer me on a bit - only 1 thing I need to do for the next hour\'. \\n\\nAnd then the ostomy nurse arrives before my friend. Docs have asked her to change my bag and insert a rubber hose into my ostomy to maybe allow trapped things to escape. I have no mental capacity left for this. After a small display of reluctance, I present my soft underbelly and submit. It isn\'t painful, but it\'s just one more bite out of my withered sense of self. Clown nose red rubber tube poking out of me, the end coiled into the bag.\\n\\nWe\'re able to visit for a short while before the docs come strolling in. They poke and gander at the tube they had asked for, and swiftly depart to the OR for someone else. They say what I\'ve consumed so far is sufficient. I\'m the private who\'s already dropped and given \'em 50 - Meh, 40 is enough. Take a break.\\n\\nChugging leaves me bloated and slightly nauseous. I\'m also mentally connecting this task with the failed bowel prep from the day before surgery. Now, we wait for the CT room to call us down. My nurse figures it\'ll be about an hour. \\n\\nAt this point, I\'m tapped out. I sit and read a book and close in on myself. One of the junior doctors comes back and says they don\'t really like the hose, they want to pull it out. Fine. Don\'t expect eye contact or social energy. He does a lousy job, pulling it from one end without securing the end about to exit my body. There\'s a little wobble and spittle of shit when the other end comes out, but we pay no major consequences for his inept technique. He leaves, saying \'CT soon\'. It\'s 3PM. \\n\\nFinally at 4PM, which is 4 full hours after my chug sprint, they bring me to get the CT. I\'m weak, mentally and physically. How do you feel? I\'m on day 11 of a 3 day hospital stay, Ms. CT Tech.\\n\\nReturn from the CT, lay around in bed. In pops Karen. This is the 2nd time that day she has surprise visited me - There are so few nice surprises in the hospital, and I\'m grateful for these hits of dopamine. That said, I\'m blown and broken and cry a little. Get it together somewhat and talk a bit. Then another friend who works at Duke stops in. More conversation. Karen takes a look at her phone, seems struck. She looks at us, and says \'I have to go - My PCR test just came back positive.\'\\n\\nSo, no more surprise visits from my wife. No more visits from her at all, really - Depending on how long our respective healing processes take. All in all, a lousy day. \\n\\nAs night falls, I\'m staring down the barrel of passing 12 hours sleepless. The beds here have some amazing technology that adjusts the pressure under every point of contact with your body. They seem to have optimized the tech to sense when you are slightly comfortable and then fix that.\\n\\nEven though I am still not cleared to consume anything (yes, even water) by mouth, I figure that\'s coming in the morning. My stomach is still in knots after the contrast chug. Fuck it, I want just a little sweet tea. Amble to the poorly guarded coffee making station, make one hot tea, use 4 sugar packets. Pour some over ice. Pretty good! Add another packet. Repeat 2x, until all 6 packets are gone into a sloshing belly full of sweet tea. It was about the only pleasure I was able to squeeze out of the day. \\n\\nBack to the room, and night doc stops in. Bitch about my back pain and soft bed. Minutes later, the doc is able to find one in a hall that looks firmer. Midnight bed change? Can\'t be worse. I\'ve already tried jamming one of the shelves from the linen closet under my lower back (to limited success). Probably not going to sleep anyway with all that tea in me. \\n\\nBut the nurse comes thru and times things to leave me alone. I get almost 4 hours of continuous sleep, more than any day in the past 10. And my ostomy produces something overnight, which means the docs are able to put me on at least clear liquid diet when they stop by at 7AM. They also say the CT scan looks good, no surprises. \\n\\nIt\'s a new day, and we\'re turning the corner. I want a sweet tea to celebrate. But there\'s no damn sugar. Nurses can\'t find any, no one is coming to re-stock. I want 6 packs of sugar, and frankly don\'t think it should be that hard. A nurse assistant lies when they say it\'s coming. Finally breakfast arrives. No doubt that some of you have eagerly anticipated the \'complaining about hospital food\' portion of this tale, so here it is. The right hand side of the tray is soaked in melted Italian ice juice. In the middle of this syrupy mess are 2 mostly unusable sugar packets. \\n\\nTake an inventory - Jolly Ranchers are sugar. So are Werthers caramels. So I go brew a hot watermelon caramel sweet tea and pour it over ice. There is no doubt the ordeal of the past 10 days has wildly warped my sense of taste. I\'ll drink that again, tho. May even serve it at parties. \\n\\nStill not sure when I\'ll get out of here. I need them to move me into solid foods, and they want to see those solid foods exit the body. My surgeon is headed to Egypt for a couple of weeks, which means I\'ll be meeting someone new Wednesday morning. I\'d guess Saturday AM, but we\'ll see.\\n\\nBut I think I\'m thru the worst of it. It\'s been tremendously traumatic. I\'m probably both tougher and more sensitive than when I came in. Looking forward to getting out. \\n\\n~Ed"},{"id":"where-i-am","metadata":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/where-i-am","source":"@site/edsBlog/2022-07-21-where-i-am.md","title":"Where I Am","description":"An update to where I am and how I got here.","date":"2022-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":3.315,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ed Hubbell","title":"Engineer @ StomaStrap & GSDware","url":"https://github.com/edhubbell","page":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/authors/ed"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/edhubbell","github":"https://github.com/edhubbell"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/edhubbell.png","key":"ed"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"where-i-am","title":"Where I Am","authors":["ed"],"tags":[]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Jolly Rancher Sweet Tea","permalink":"/edsBlog/jolly-rancher"},"nextItem":{"title":"The ICU","permalink":"/edsBlog/the-icu"}},"content":"An update to where I am and how I got here. \\n \\nI\'m currently still at Duke Hospital, but I am out of the ICU. Today is my 7th day at the hospital, and my 8th day since consuming any solid food. The procedure was supposed to be laparoscopic and robotic, meaning small holes, little scarring, and a 2-3 day hospital stay. \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e \\n\\nLeading up to the surgery, I had to do some things that were very similar to the colonoscopy prep steps that each and every one of you over 45 should be personally experienced with. Namely, chugging 2 big jugs of liquid in a short time frame, and having a rough night crapping most of that out. \\n \\nMy prep didn\'t go as expected, as I still put brown stool into the toilet on Friday morning. Re-checked my meds to make sure I had followed the right steps. I mentioned this to the doctor, but he said things didn\'t have to be perfect, as we weren\'t doing a colonoscopy. I felt bloated and nervous, but didn\'t really think thru the situation and was comforted by his assurance that it was probably fine. \\n \\nAs I understand it, during the surgery, the missing 2 liters of Gatorade and Miralax were found when they emptied into the surgical field. The time for small holes was over. It went immediately to an open surgery. I got an eight inch gash down the middle of my belly, and they irrigated 10 liters of sterile fluid into the abdomen, hoping to flush the shit out. (Note: the term \'shit\' is literal in this instance) They removed the damaged part of my rectum and tried sewing things back up. \\n \\nI came to and heard some of this - It\'s all pretty foggy. Then by 9PM they were saying that there was already a leak at the site, and they had to go in to try to fix it pretty much now and could I sign this. Also, the odds that they\'d be able to fix it were slim, and that I\'d probably wake up with a permanent colostomy.\\n \\nComing to the 2nd time at who knows what AM, I kept asking people what the status was, if it was a permanent ostomy or what. No one was giving me straight answers. I think it was Karen that finally let me know. \\n \\nSo all told, I was in surgery for ~14-16 hours on Friday into Saturday AM. Then into the surgery ICU for a couple days, then stabilized enough to move into a regular post surgical ward, where I sit now. Still no predicted departure date, although today my ostomy produced 350ml of stool, which means the connection from stomach to endpoint is working at least a little. \\n \\nBelly is swollen. As thirsty as I have ever been in all my life. No sleep more than 2 hours at a stretch. Dreams so realistic and chilling that nursing got involved. Itchy. NG tube down my nose into my throat. Hurts to talk. Etc.\\n \\nMaybe one so-so nurse. Lots of great nurses. A few greater than great nurses. I now love nurses.\\n \\nSo I\'m still in the hospital, things are improving day by day. From now on, I\'ll be as likely to shit my shirts as my shorts. Mentally I\'m OK - More traumatized by the length and conditions of this hospital stay than its aftereffects. \\n \\nWhen I do get out, I will kill for a \'Pretty Princess\' Pelican SnoBall and tall ice cold glasses of water in quantity.  \\n \\nOK, that\'s all I can sit up and type for now. I know Karen has been updating some folks, but I wanted to put something out on this channel so people can talk to her about something else. Karen, of course, has been wonderful and useful and supportive throughout. She knows how much I love her, and I think y\'all do as well. \\n \\nUntil I get out of here - \\n~Ed"},{"id":"the-icu","metadata":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/the-icu","source":"@site/edsBlog/2022-07-16-the-icu.md","title":"The ICU","description":"I\'m in the ICU.

First off, if they are paying $30 a month to host this site, they are paying about $25 too much. I\'m not saying that you should not donate to CaringBridge - It\'s a great central (and free) spot to allow patients to communicate with loved ones. However, it seems like some folks have donated with the expectation that some portion of that donation benefits me directly (We\'re looking at you, user Treat Yo Self). The language that CaringBridge uses doesn\'t attempt to correct that impression. I find it slightly manipulative. \\n \\nAnd now, on with the show. \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e \\n\\nSurgery tomorrow 7/15 @ 7:15AM, which means no food today, and colonoscopy-like prep tonight. I\'m feeling good physically, while mentally anxious to get this procedure done. \\n \\nRecap: The ~8 hour procedure will remove most of my rectum, and re-attach the healthy part of my colon to whatever small stump of rectum (close to the sphincter) they can leave in. That connection needs time to heal - So I\'ll have an ileostomy (hole in the abdomen that connects to the small intestine) for about 3 months. At least 90 days of a poop bag and modified diet. Then back in for another procedure to reverse the ileostomy and try out the repaired bunghole. All of this is best-case scenario. \\n \\nThey use a robot, so (barring complications) the incisions should be small. Doc says my relatively skinny frame makes the procedure more difficult. Patients tend to be in the hospital 2-3 nights. I like to think I\'m a fast healer, so I\'ll be aiming to come back home Sunday. I also like to think I\'m relatively healthy, but (spoiler) that isn\'t true at all. So we\'ll see how it all shakes out.\\n \\nI\'ve been dealing with fewer bouts of blood in my stool lately - Usually no more than once every 3 weeks or so. Started to think that maybe things were all healing up, but this morning that symptom returned. Surprise - COVID didn\'t kill the tumor. \\n \\nBiggest dread is waking up from anesthesia Friday afternoon to a doctor telling me some kind of bad news. That\'s not necessarily going to happen, but it has the past couple times I\'ve been under. As soon as I come to, it\'ll be time to start looking for clues in the faces and actions around me to get a sense of the situation. The weight of the styrofoam ice water cup in my hand and the urge to throw it at the printer across the hall after \'It\'s definitely cancer\' - Those memories are clear.\\n \\nI\'m tempted to record more of what my expectations are for post-procedure, but it\'d make for dull reading. It\'s enough to say that pre-procedure we were all hoping for the best. We\'ll deal with anything less than that as it comes. At a minimum, no driving for 2 weeks and no lifting over 5lbs for 6 weeks. Not looking forward to coping with my diminished capacity.\\n \\nThis afternoon, while on the way to Walmart for jock itch spray, the idea occurred to just keep driving. Never strongly considered it, but understood my desire to stay in this \'before\' moment. Before, when everything might still be OK. Before the first impossibly difficult conversations. Before the \'last time\' march starts. And then again, maybe it will all be OK. Maybe they get it all.\\n \\nKaren had to cancel a vacation for next week in order to be around for post surgery support. I encouraged her to go anyway, but evidently she\'s taking the whole \'sickness and health\' vow literally. Thankful for that, but sad to be the cause of missed vacations. The kids will go to Myrtle Beach Friday-Sunday, so should have a full mini-golf and pancake house report on their return. \\n \\nThanks to all of you for your support as we move through this shitty situation. Talk at y\'all after. \\n\\n~Ed"},{"id":"covid","metadata":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/covid","source":"@site/edsBlog/2022-06-22-covid.md","title":"COVID","description":"There is a pre-surgery COVID screening test.

I forget things easily, even things as seemingly unforgettable as \u2018how I felt during cancer treatment\u2019. Seems I\u2019ve made it thru my sub-150lb phase without a whole lot of photos of me \u2013 I don\u2019t need Facebook reminding me of this time. I do need something, tho.\\n\\nPoint being that some entries are entertaining well written accounts of my thoughts, and others are boring accounts of events. This is, without apology, more the latter.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e  \\n\\nPre-Appointment Status:\\n\\nToday is a big one. Last night I got an MRI of my pelvis. The results from that MRI are used to re-stage my tumor. The intent of the radiation treatments and subsequent chemo were to shrink the tumor so that surgery is easier and more effective. My hope is that the tumor is smaller. My dream is that it is no longer detectable. The term for this level of response is Complete Clinical Response, or CCR.\\n\\nThe odds of CCR from short course radiation followed by 8 cycles of FOLFOX chemo is somewhere around 20 to 30 percent. Not great odds. So I\u2019m trying to temper my hopes for this morning\u2019s results.\\n\\nI\u2019m typing this while sitting and waiting for my appointment. I\u2019ve got an extra 10 minutes or so.\\n\\nThis appointment is going to be traumatic either way. A full rectal exam without any anesthesia isn\u2019t fun, and I know this already. You should too, and you should go get a colonoscopy if you haven\u2019t. My experience is that in comparison to a full rectal exam, the colonoscopy is downright pleasant.\\n\\nThe instructions for appointment prep included an AM saline enema, from which I\u2019m still recovering. Still, the prognosis coming out of this appointment is important. Today is a day that I can receive good/neutral/bad news. In an effort to temper my expectations, it is worth quantifying what would constitute good news.\\n\\nBad news would be no tumor downstaging at all. That would pretty much mean that the past 5 months of treatments were a waste of time. It would have been better to just plunk me into the OR back in November when I was diagnosed.\\n\\nFair news would be some downstaging of the tumor. Some shrinking of the surrounding lymph nodes, etc. That\u2019s about what we expect to hear.\\n\\nThen there is what Karen and I are calling \u2018The Ralphie\u2019, in reference to the scene in A Christmas Story. I told Karen that my ideal interaction would be the surgeon asking me what supplements I had taken in the past 4 months. He\u2019s trying to understand what factors went into one of the best tumor responses he\u2019s ever seen, and a complete clinical response for sure. Karen compared my fantasy to Ralphie\u2019s teacher grading the Red Rider BB-gun essay \u2013 \u2018A + + + +\u2019.\\n\\nIn the past few months, I\u2019ve gotten early radiology reports from Duke\u2019s MyChart system. It has led to panic in some cases, where a software engineer tries to make sense of radiology\u2019s technical jargon. In this case, they\u2019ve clamped down the radiology report. I keep checking my phone to no avail. Maybe they want to deliver the good news in person. Maybe it is terrible news, like spread to other adjacent areas or just no shrinkage at all. And then again, maybe it is just new protocol. Sending every patient raw radiology reports as soon as they are pushed into the system can\u2019t be good for overall morale \u2013 Of patients or doctors. Some software engineer probably didn\u2019t understand that.\\n\\nIn any case, I\u2019ll know more this evening than I do now. I\u2019ll close this portion with a note to myself to try to cope with whatever news is coming in a productive way. If it\u2019s good news, try to celebrate it a little - Even though it\u2019s about the 3rd inning, home runs deserve a hi-five. Neutral or bad news will mean continued strength and perseverance. In the event of \u2018The Ralphie\u2019, the rest of this entry will consist of exclamation points.  \\n\\n \\n\\nPost-Appointment Status:\\n\\nI had more than 10 extra minutes, that\u2019s for sure. Didn\u2019t see the doc until about 1:30AM for a 10:30AM appointment.\\n\\nIn summation: Meh. No bad news, so that\u2019s good. According to the MRI, the tumor didn\u2019t shrink very much. The surrounding lymph nodes do look better than they did initially, so that\u2019s one for the win column. MRI didn\u2019t show any additional spread of the cancer.\\n\\nHad to self-administer 2 enemas today to prep for a rectal exam. The enemas caused rectal irritation and bleeding. Surgeon couldn\u2019t see the tumor during the exam due to the copious amounts of blood. Blood due to the irritation from enemas. The enemas used to prep for the exam.\\n\\nI\u2019m down for a few reasons (apart from acute rectal irritation).\\n\\nI was really focused over the past few months on trying all kinds of things to get my body to expel this cancer. I read up on supplements and vitamins, tried fasting during chemo, amped up my iron consumption for a while. Also, all cool vibes, prayers, and best wishes were heartily accepted. All while undergoing the standard medical treatments. I wanted to be in that special 30% of Clinical Complete Response patients. Today that possibility went away. All my trying added up to about zilch.\\n\\nI was also hopeful that there was still some possibility I could go on the \u2018watch and wait\u2019 protocol and duck surgery entirely. It was somewhere between \u2018a small secret hope held deep in the heart\u2019 and \u2018lottery ticket\u2019. With the tumor still visible on MRI, it\u2019s not remotely an option. Bright side is that\u2019s one less decision to worry about.  \\n\\nNow I have a surgery date. My first surgery is scheduled for June 23rd. Likely a 3 day hospital stay involved. Robotic surgery. Can\u2019t drive for 2 weeks after, can\u2019t lift anything for 6 weeks. I was told I could walk \u2018as much as I want\u2019. I\u2019ll have a temporary ileostomy after the surgery, so my diet will have to change somewhat. None of it sound pleasant, but it\u2019s what needs to happen. See attached image for how much of my digestive tract (Section \u2018B\u2019) will be rendered.\\n\\nThe wait is difficult. Rip off the bandage? No, mummy, we\u2019ll spin this duct tape off you for the next 8 weeks. Slowly. Still, there are parts of me that are at their functional peak until a couple of months from now. Any heavy lifting I want to do this summer needs to happen soon.\\n\\nAbout 10 years ago, I had a fungal infection on my big toe. The doc took off the entire nail. \u2018I can put a chemical on the nail bed \u2013 So the nail won\u2019t grow back.\u2019 Then, I thought giving up on a big toenail at 40 was drastic. \u2018The fungus is just going to come back\u2019. I let the nail grow back. Doc was right - That toe is the ugliest visible part of my body.\\n\\nIt\u2019s a vast distance between \u2018big toenail/fungal infection\u2019 to \u2018most of your rectum/cancer\u2019. Hard not to feel like parts are coming off this bus. Still, rolling.\\n\\n~Ed"},{"id":"last-chemo","metadata":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/last-chemo","source":"@site/edsBlog/2022-04-08-last-chemo.md","title":"Last Chemo","description":"TLDR: Finished last scheduled chemo today.

Feeling much better overall.\\n\\nI read an article recently about a European philosopher who described this post-atomic age we live in as \u2018The Reprieve\u2019. The gist is that mankind developed the means to exterminate itself, and it is only a matter of time before it happens. It\u2019s a bleak concept for a Friday, so I\u2019ll not dwell on it.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e \\n\\nI\u2019m living in a short reprieve between treatments, with the dark cloud of multiple surgeries on my horizon. My last scheduled chemo treatment concluded this morning. It is nice to have that stage behind me. Now I wait a few weeks to heal from this last chemo session, and then go in for some scans to see the state of the tumor.\\n\\nQuick aside here \u2013 I was initially scheduled for 9 chemo treatments on 2 week intervals. During the visit for my 6th treatment, I told them I had decided to discontinue the oxaliplatin portion of chemo (which is the chemical with the most challenging short- and long-term effects). During that appointment, the oncologist suggested that we could do just 8 treatments instead of 9. \u2018Eight, nine, it\u2019s arbitrary\u2019. Seemed odd to me. I was expecting a fight over my decision to stop the oxaliplatin, and instead I got agreement on the oxaliplatin and a chemo cycle reduction. Asked for a kitten and got a pony.\\n\\nFast forward to my 8th appointment this Wednesday, and they said \u2018You\u2019re doing pretty well \u2013 We could do 9 treatments\u2019. Sure, I said, I could do 9. At Siteman in St. Louis, they are doing 12. \u2018Yes, but they are doing FOLFOX and you decided to drop the oxaliplatin\u2019. OK \u2013 So is there an advantage to doing 9 treatments? \u2018Not that I can see\u2019. OK\u2026 Well, let\u2019s do 8 then?\\n\\nBear in mind none of this is based on any scans or data taken. There is no CT scan / blood test / MRI / colonoscopy image that suggests I need more chemo or that I\u2019ve had enough. This drives me nuts as an engineer, as I want to see data points to help drive decision making. Instead of data, we seem to be using whim and mood coupled with gut instinct.\\n\\nThe good news: I am feeling a whole lot better than I was from mid December to mid March. This is mostly the result of healing of the radiation proctitis (injury to the rectal area due to the radiation treatment) and a hemorrhoid that ceased thrombosing (de-thrombosed?). My daily pain level is much lower. Sleeping 3 hours at a stretch is no longer rare. I\u2019m able to get out of the house some, and my bowel control is much better than it was. It\u2019s still bad enough that I crapped myself in the plumbing aisle at Home Depot \u2013 But the fact that I felt good enough to try to get out of the house (or consider plumbing) is an improvement. I even celebrated my end-of-chemo by driving 40 minutes out to Saxapahaw to catch a Todd Snider show last night. That\u2019s as far from home as I\u2019ve been since December.\\n\\nI\u2019m now in a short period during which I should feel a little better every day AND not be subjected to any bad news. Once we get the scans scheduled and done, we\u2019ll know more about the state of the tumor. The goal of the radiation and chemo treatments that I\u2019ve been through is that the tumor will be smaller (or even gone). Hopefully the scans that I\u2019ll go thru will allow us to downstage the tumor \u2013 So instead of a T3, maybe it\u2019ll be a T1 or T0. We\u2019ll also be hoping that the inflamed lymph node looks better than it was. A smaller tumor makes surgery easier and local recurrence less likely.\\n\\nI\u2019m anxious about the surgeries and the associated side effects. I\u2019m part of some colorectal cancer groups on FB, and they don\u2019t always provide much comfort. Still, there are many factors in my favor. My CEA numbers were low during my initial treatment, and my residual tumor DNA test (Signatera) came back negative early in my chemo cycles. This suggests that there hasn\u2019t been a lot of tumor shedding into my blood (which hopefully means metastatic spread to other areas is less likely).\\n\\nI\u2019m torn about celebrating the end of chemo. Growing up, my dad often said \u2018They don\u2019t payoff at halftime\u2019 (sorry, UNC). I\u2019m about 1/3 of the way through my scheduled treatments. Two surgeries are in my immediate future, which means about another 5 months of healing and reduced capability. The end of chemo isn\u2019t nearly the end of treatment. There\u2019s also the possibility that I\u2019d need post-surgical chemo as well.\\n\\nFor today, I\u2019ve taken myself out and bought about 5 different pastries and hogged some of all of them down. Trying to celebrate even the small victories (through my admittedly unhealthy default method, the consumption of white flour).\\n\\n~Ed"},{"id":"paperboi","metadata":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/paperboi","source":"@site/edsBlog/2022-03-04-paperboi.md","title":"Paperboi","description":"Income sources for kids growing up in the suburbs of Connecticut in the 80s were limited to the usual suspects: Mowing lawns, shoveling snow, babysitting kids, and delivering papers.

I fell into paper delivery.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e \\n\\nThe deliveries were easy enough. Sometimes multiple trips were needed - Especially with the New Haven Register Sunday edition. They\'d drop off the comics and coupons on Saturday, allowing you to either a) deliver them early, or b) collate them into a single Sunday edition the next morning. A standard spring-arm bike rack might carry 3 to 4 Sunday editions at most - A 25 house route meant multiple trips. I recall begging my father to do the route from the car. His response usually matched what mine would be if my kids asked me to drive them around on Halloween night.\\n\\nDelivery was a manageable chore. What I really dreaded was what we all called \'collecting\'. Every week, you were supposed to go out to each customer with your little book of tickets and tell them how many weeks they owed you for. Knocking on doors, listening to dogs bark, asking folks for money. All scenes from an introvert\'s nightmare.\\n\\nThe chance that I might get a tip was not close to enough motivation for me. Invariably, I\'d procrastinate a week or two or four, until the amounts owed blossomed from a couple of bucks into a full grown fiver. Some part of me knew this was self sabotage - The messenger\u2019s task never gets easier with time.\\n\\nDon\'t jump ahead to conclusions, reader - There is no terrible news to share regarding my prognosis. The treatments for my cancer are still on-track. My doctors are optimistic that my cancer is responding to treatment, and that I have good chance at a post-cancer existence. The mental and physical outlines of the shape of that existence are unknown and frightening. I\'ll cross those bridges as they come.\\n\\nThe conditions of my daily existence right now are difficult, and have been for some time. Most of what I\'m dealing with are still side effects from radiation - a condition called acute radiation proctitis. This means that the last 5 inches or so of the rectum are inflamed due to damage from the radiation aimed at the tumor. I\'ve also had to deal with a thrombosed hemorrhoid, which is incredibly painful.\\n\\nThe symptoms of the inflammation manifest themselves in several different ways. Straight up pain is one. Pain during defecation is another, due to the narrowed passage. There are multiple daily spasms that start in the rectum and cause my entire abdomen to clench tight. Above all of this is the numb sensation that I no longer have complete control or sense of what\'s happening down there. Farts come out of nowhere, complete with mucus from my healing rectum. Full bowel movements commence moments after abandoning a fruitless 10 minute bathroom visit.\\n\\nThere is also the uncertainty of how much of the damage is permanent. My initial complaints in late December were met with assertions that symptoms usually pass within a week or two. We\'re months past that optimism. Dr. Google says that acute radiation proctitis can last up to 6 months, but that just seems to be the point at which the diagnosis changes from \'acute\' to \'chronic\'. My life for the last 2 months has been an effective brochure for the advantages offered by a permanent colostomy.\\n\\nI\'m not in constant pain, but my pain hits a level 3-4 out of 10 for several hours almost every day. Some hours pass during which I can eat and sit comfortably, even take a walk. Other times I\'m in a condition where it hurts just to stand, and sitting is torture. The pain schedule isn\'t published or predictable. Most of my comfortable sitting time is dedicated to getting some work done, which is a welcome escape.\\n\\nPrior to my diagnosis (and for a few weeks after), I was playing soccer and basketball three to four times a week. My skills were almost exclusively in the areas of speed and hustle. One would never guess that from the speed of my gait now.\\n\\nDepends are my underwear, and have been since December. Three months ago, I had no standard for what constitutes a \'clean enough\' pair of Depends. I\'ve developed one in the interim, and it is low enough to discourage description here.  Over the past few months, I\'ve come up with some interesting origami-style toilet paper lining strategies to allow a pair to last 24 hours. Most bathroom trips are post-flatulence, to change out the mucous stained toilet tissue. I set an arbitrary guideline back in January - Pass 48 consecutive hours without crapping yourself before dining outside the home. Haven\'t come close yet.\\n\\nFolks ask a lot about my appetite, how I\'m dealing with chemo, etc. Chemo is not fun, and chemo days are worse to be sure. My hands and feet are starting to feel the impact of neuropathy, a known universal symptom of oxaliplatin infusion. Nausea on the days after chemo is an issue. There\'s also the matter of my emergency hospitalization after my 2nd chemo treatment - Another check in the minus column.\\n\\nHowever, the chemo side effects have largely been manageable. There are plenty of side effects for my course of treatment that I\'ve been lucky enough to miss out on. Mouth sores, chemo brain fog, taste bud changes, lack of appetite - These haven\'t been an issue. I\'m more than 1/2 way thru my chemo treatments, so hopefully my luck holds.\\n\\nMy emotional state is volatile - Maybe fragile is more accurate. I\'ve cried more in the past 2 months than in the last 10 years. I play guitar almost every day, but I\'m stuck on 3 or 4 songs. Most of the songs I sing or play regularly carry enough emotional weight to cause my voice to break and tears to form. It is a therapeutic exercise, and I\'m grateful for the release. Still need to find a few more songs tho.\\n\\nMy family relationships are good. Karen has been a rock of support, and the kids have been kind and helpful. Their accounts may differ, but I\'d say I\'ve mostly been able to keep my pain from ruining my temper. They were able to get away and go skiing last weekend in Colorado. Normally I skip skiing trips anyway, so I didn\'t miss out. Mostly I was happy to have the weekend to recuperate from chemo in private. I don\'t like to do much suffering in public. Also, really happy they were able to get away and have fun - I don\'t need them sitting shiva for the next 6 months.\\n\\nThat leads us to this update. Folks are concerned because I\'ve been lax about updating this site with the latest news. I\'ve been slow to update because there hasn\'t been much that\'s funny or fun to talk about, and I don\'t really want to bitch and moan. I\'d rather suffer privately, or at least quietly. The longer this stage progresses, the easier it is to delay collecting for another week. \\n\\nYes, I\'m halfway thru chemo, and that\'s a positive. Visitors (depending on what the pain is like when they see me) can get the impression my condition is improving. That\'s not inaccurate, although the improvement is more gradual than I\'d like.\\n\\nMy reality, however, is that the chemo is only the first step in a treatment plan that will take many more months. I\'ve got 4 more chemo treatments, which will take me into late April. Then a short span of healing, followed by scans to evaluate how well the cancer responded to chemo and radiation. Following that, a surgery that leaves me with a temporary ostomy and all the attendant diet and personal care adjustments. Provided all of that goes well, then a three month wait until an additional surgery to re-attach my colon to my rectum, and months of adjustment to whatever new normal awaits.\\n\\nThat\'s a lot to take in, and a lot to type out - Even when glossing over the details (and yes, I left stuff out). Compared to the cancer support groups I\'m a part of, I\'ve got plenty to be optimistic about. I\'m grateful for that, to be sure. There\'s still a lot of hard road ahead.\\n\\nLast, thanks everyone for the help and support they\'ve offered/given/etc. There are plenty of folks who have asked what they can do, and often the true answer I have is \'nothing\'. Every time there has been something, folks have stepped up. There\'s also my heartfelt-conversation-daily-limit to contend with.  I\'ll keep trying to spread tasks around so everyone gets a chance to help (and so I get to connect with everyone).\\n\\nMuch love -\\n\\n \\n\\n~Ed"},{"id":"restraints","metadata":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/restraints","source":"@site/edsBlog/2022-01-17-restraints.md","title":"Restraints","description":"Saturday morning, I woke up in a bed at Duke Hospital in wrist restraints.

Crazy how a simple overhand knotted strap combined with a compromised mental state results in total capitulation and acceptance.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e \\n\\nForgive me for jumping ahead. Previously, I introduced the Chekhov\u2019s gun of chemotherapy. Now we\'re off in a whole different direction of emergency hospital stays, and CT scans, and Foley catheters. Look, I\'m along for the ride with y\'all. I don\'t know where this is headed. Based on recent history, endless digressions seem to form the path.\\n\\nWhat I do know is that between late Thursday morning and Saturday afternoon, I lost about 8 pounds and 36 hours. The weight I\'ll get back, but the time - It\'s gone-gone. We\'ll have to rely on witness testimony to fill in the gaps, along with some sparse text exchange records. \\n\\nWednesday afternoon I started my 2nd round of chemo. Things went well, all things considered. I came home with the pressure pump that jams the 5FU into the port in my chest. It was a long day at a medical facility based on the scale I had experienced to that point - 6 hours is a lot of sitting around. Went to bed Wednesday night without major issues.\\n\\nThe last thing I remember Thursday is vomiting in the toilet. According to text records, Karen was worried that the kids might be home and see that. We were still in the stage where \'Dad throwing up\' might be stressful for the children. I joked that the vomit was melting the grout in our newly refinished bathroom. Evidently I also complained that I didn\'t get any work done at all.\\n\\nFriday AM, Karen found me on my usual throne, unable to follow commands. Lights on, no one home. The lone eyewitness account states that I walked over to the bed, Depends around my ankles, and just sat down. Karen was comforted by my gait, in that it was regular. This suggests that the patient has not had a stroke in the motor portion of the brain. The patient wasn\u2019t speaking or following commands. So it was time for a ride in the ambulance to the ER. I remember not one bit of the ride, nor the rest of Friday.\\n\\nKaren then spent from 9AM until 11PM with me at the ER, taking a slight break in the afternoon so she could go receive her 4th of 5 radiation treatments for breast cancer. That\'s a 14 hour slog. She had to drive herself, because COVID restrictions prevented her from joining me on my ambulance ride. She also helped hold me down in the ER when they inserted a Foley catheter in my urethra. She\'s more woman than I am man. And she proofreads this journal for medical accuracy! I\u2019m lucky to have her and love her very much.  \\n\\nThe CT and MRI that they did showed some brain inflammation \u2013 Encephalopathy for the medically minded. Best they can figure, the cause was a bad reaction to the 5FU chemotherapy. This wasn\'t evident to me when I came to around 6AM, restrained, in a hospital bed. I was plenty confused, dehydrated, and all-around out of it.\\n\\nMy nurse Cecil was a lovely man from Sierra Leone. We were alone together for some time. He asked me if I knew why I had restraints on - I did not. He asked me why I was in the hospital, and I replied something-something-\'cancer\'-something. This seemed to convince him that I had no intentions for self harm, so he removed the restraints. Cecil was the most lovely man I hope never to need the services of again. Although I do wish he would have challenged me to take the restraints off Houdini-style. Part of me thinks I could have managed it.\\n\\nAround 9AM, some doctors came busting in the room. One of them had the disembodied voice of my wife. The other 2 were working for pay, and asking inane questions. Some examples: \'Do you remember why you are here?\', \'Do you know what year it is?\', and \'Can you tell me the month?\'. I\'m proud to live in the here and now, with little regard for the constraints of the Gregorian calendar. Come to think of it, next time, that\'s what I\'ll say. Instead, I said something about 2020. And then 2022. And December. No? January?\\n\\nI still had my sense of humor throughout. Jokes about experiments with heroin as an anti-cancer drug go over well when they have a full toxicology report on you.\\n\\nOnce we were alone, Karen relayed the rest of the story. She also increased the urgency level by reminding me that the snowpocalpyse was impending, and that I\'d probably be better off and all around happier observing that from the vantage of our home, rather than a hospital window. The docs at Duke seemed amenable to letting Karen spring me \u2013 I\u2019m not sure they\'d do the same if my partner wasn\'t a doctor. All I had to do was show them I could eat something.\\n\\nSad to say, the thing they wanted me to eat was (spoiler alert) hospital food. The food therapist started me out with applesauce. After a few bites, I mentioned my mild allergy to apples. We progressed to Graham crackers - They were outstanding. After being cleared to eat, it was time to select from the vast Duke Hospital menu. No joke - It\'s like a diner menu. Karen chose the turkey and mashed potatoes for me, after which I passed out for a couple of hours.\\n\\nWaking, around 1PM, Karen let me know it was now or never. Turkey is normally pretty taste free, but this was exceptionally dry as well. Adding salt improved things somewhat, in that afterwards it tasted like salt. And etc. When the nurse came in and asked if I had eaten all of that, I didn\'t reply \'Well, my wife ate some\'. Even in my state, I knew what the right answers were.\\n\\nAfter arriving home, I was granted just about any food wish I desired. All I wanted was some Hutchins pizza, which went down just fine.\\n\\nI wasn\'t able to play guitar when I got back home, which was extremely distressing. My fingers weren\'t able to do the alternate bass picking that I use most of the time - Kept striking the wrong strings. It\'s something that means a lot to me, given how much time it took to develop those skills. It\'s not a facet of my life that most people see, but playing is a big part of my inner identity. Seeing that skill disappear in a matter of days was maybe the most difficult moment of the weekend. Happy to report that I was able to play this morning. Not especially well, but well enough that I\'m feeling OK about where I\'m at.\\n\\nSunday night I gained probably 2 pounds in carbonara weight alone. I\'m feeling better every day - Today I\'m pretty much back where I was early last week. It\'s like the whole thing never happened (which is at least half true for my brain).\\n\\nLast, thanks to all the neighbors and friends who helped or offered to help Karen and the kids get thru the weekend. I\'m happy to be back home. I promise (?) that my next update will have less drama.\\n\\n~Ed"},{"id":"second-chemo-dose","metadata":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/second-chemo-dose","source":"@site/edsBlog/2022-01-12-second-chemo-dose.md","title":"Second Chemo Dose","description":"I got my 2nd dose of chemo started today.

There are some really quaint cancer treatment guidelines that say if you are experiencing 7 or more bowel movements over your standard, that qualifies you as a grade 3 toxicity, and that maybe hospitalization should be considered. Showing big cards (like 40 bms in 24 hours, or 8mg over the daily max dose of Imodium) got the table\'s attention. Bringing a lucid exhausted incontinent patient in for a hydration IV wasn\'t anyone\'s idea of a good morning. Having a physician on hand to tell them that I wasn\'t really all that dehydrated probably helped. Karen brought in a stool sample that tested negative for c-diff. Then they were able to write a script for some diphenoxylate-atropine, which Karen was able to pick up for me. Doctorin\' AND deliverin\' - She\'s a keeper.\\n \\nThe diphenoxylate is chemically related to some narcotics and can be habit forming if used in excess of 4x a day. I contend that any medication that cuts toilet trips by twenty in 24 hours will be habit forming. Since Monday, I\'ve had 2 nights of actual sleep. Dreamt of a Muppet too heavy to defenestrate. Then one with anxiety about heading into downtown St. Louis in underwear; coped by digging in the rental car rear wheel well sandbox. Most schools of psychology agree that the details aren\'t important. What is important is REM sleep. \\n \\nTalked with the nutritionist - She game me permission to eat things other than rice, bananas, white bread, and oatmeal. They weren\'t helping, so no harm in expanding outside of the beige palate. Celebrated with a lunch of takeout sushi in excess. I\'m still homebound, but things are on the upswing.\\n \\nNow, I\'m sitting on the couch with a balloon pump full of 5FU that will drip into me until Friday at 4PM. I\'m tired, because spending 6 hours at a cancer center takes a lot out of me. It is at least as bad as going to the dentist. Plus, Karen is sitting next to me after going thru her 2nd of 5 radiation treatments, so the couch cancer quotient is maximized. Chemo edification will wait for a later date.\\n\\n~Ed"},{"id":"gorey-details","metadata":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/gorey-details","source":"@site/edsBlog/2022-01-09-gorey-details.md","title":"Gorey Details","description":"I haven\'t offered any updates in a while.

The past 3 weeks didn\'t offer much material in that vein.\\n\\nSo, I\'m going to give you the up-to-the-minute good news. This weekend (Jan 8-9th), I\'ve felt better than I have since around Dec 20th. My prognosis hasn\'t changed for the worse. I tolerated my first chemotherapy session reasonably well. My oncologist seems onboard with my request to get residual DNA blood testing (Signatera) started in the near future. Perhaps best and most dramatic of all, the Durham Fire department was able to address the audible natural gas leak at our house - Neither death nor dismemberment for all present.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e \\n\\nYou can stop reading now. I\'m fine. I\'m sitting up in bed, typing, comfortable. My mood is good. The rest of this update will be heavy on GI symptoms that aren\'t pretty. I\'m writing them down as an act of personal recordkeeping, so I can look back and remember how bad things were at this time. You can read on, or skip and wait for the next update (in which I will play the protagonist who handily triumphs over some minor short term adversity while simultaneously resisting the base instinct to parlay that chance victory into some larger optimistic ideology).\\n\\n~Ed\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nGory details:\\n\\nI thought I had tolerated the radiation therapy really well. A week outside of treatment, the only symptom I had was some lower back pain - which was immediately addressed via some scheduled ibuprofen dosing. Then late December came rolling in.\\n\\n \\n\\nSince Dec 20th, I\'ve\\n\\n \\n\\n- had diarrhea pretty much continuously\\n- gained firsthand experience on the symptoms of radiation induced rectal proctitis\\n- given up on underwear in favor of Depends\\n- not \'made it in time\' on more than one occasion (from a room in my own home adjacent to a bathroom)\\n- had multiple 24 hour periods during which my bathroom visit total was >= 40\\n- not slept more than 4 hours in a row (and that only 2x)\\n- pretty much not left the house\\n- eaten more bananas and oatmeal than in the entire year previous\\n- on my best day, played one session of futsal in an adult diaper (disaster free)\\n- taken Imodium in quantities well over the suggested max daily dose\\n- lost about 10 pounds\\n- hydrojetted our main sewer line to unclog it 3 times (tangentially related to the household toilet tissue consumption rate)\\n\\nIt seems as if I\'ve seamlessly moved from post-radiation induced GI symptoms into the post-chemotherapy induced GI symptoms. Both sets of symptoms are usually temporary. The post-radiation symptoms were particularly galling, as they involved many trips to the bathroom without much output. It was often like dry heaves, but on the opposite end.\\n\\nDue to these symptoms, this was one of the most depressing Christmas seasons I\'ve ever been a part of (Yes, worse even than Christmas Day I both worked manufacturing and was screened for an STI at Duke urgent care). We had in-laws and cousins come into town from DC and Arizona. My folks came up from Myrtle Beach. I mostly stayed in my room and tried to rest. Couldn\'t really eat, can\'t drink alcohol, can\'t get much rest.\\n\\nPursuit of rest was complicated by the fact that Karen was concurrently leading the charge on a master bathroom renovation. I was and am not happy about the timing of that renovation. Still, it looks nice. I can see the advantages of a job done rather than a perfect job undone. It\u2019s good to have something for houseguests to accomplish. I also appreciate the efforts my family took to help along Karen\'s priorities. She deserves the help and the love. That said, it\'s pretty much my private bathroom whenever I\'m upstairs. The only thing between me and a bathroom is the stiffarm I\'ll dish out on the way by.\\n\\nI was usually able to make some kind of appearance during Christmas-time dinners, etc. There was one great sushi meal that I was able to take part in. Mostly, I just felt like a sick ghoul and wanted to be left alone. Wasn\u2019t able to cook or host in any meaningful capacity.\\n\\nI was able to make it to my first chemo appointment on Wednesday, Dec 29th. I had fasted from Monday at 9PM until the infusion on Wednesday afternoon (and well into Friday). Somehow, I was able to make it for 6 hours at the Duke Cancer center without a serious bathroom incident. The next few days were mentally challenging, in that I had a pump of 5FU poison attached to the port in my chest. Physically, however, they went fine. Very little nausea or dizziness, no vomiting. Good appetite when I broke my fast. GI issues abated for a bit, as there was no food in my system whatsoever.\\n\\nI iced my hands, feet, and mouth during the 2 hour oxaliplatin infusion, so I didn\'t have any severe cold sensitivity afterwards. Oxaliplatin is a potent neurotoxin that can have side effects that include permanent neuropathy. I\'d like to continue playing guitar/typing/buttoning my own shirts - Hence the prospect of this specific side effect causes me high levels of anxiety.\\n\\nIn some ways, I\'m not missing out on much - The omicron surge is contracting a lot of social circles. Still, hard for me to see that as much of a silver lining. I\'m homebound and incontinent. I\'m not in a lot of pain, but I am in pain fairly often. I can\'t eat much other than oatmeal, rice, and toast. Absent for now are many of the little joys - sports, food, cocktails, workouts, socializing - that I used to build my day around. I know some of those conditions are temporary. Still, my \'quality of life\' graph has a line straight down that started on Dec 20th, and has yet to change direction (Engineers would be wise to keep any observations on slope change to themselves).  \\n\\nI\'ve been to the bathroom 6x in the hour since I started this journal entry. If you took the under on 4, you\'re out. Also hydrojetted the main sewer line, which clogged due to a sudden rainstorm. So I think that makes 4 times in the past 3 weeks.\\n\\nAs of now, I plan on starting my Monday off in pursuit of an escalation of my condition so we can get to the next tier of prescription medical intervention. I could be in worse shape, and I\'m improving."},{"id":"radiation-vibe","metadata":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/radiation-vibe","source":"@site/edsBlog/2021-12-12-radiation-vibe.md","title":"Radiation Vibe","description":"5/5 radiation treatments done.

Keep the shirt on, but pants and underwear are gone. Walk down the hall like that, clutching the robe closed while carrying whatever you brought. They check my name and birthdate. I check to make sure there\'s a picture of me on their computer - I don\'t want someone else\'s radiation. Then go into a room where they are so nice about trying to offer some privacy before lying down bottomless on the table. Told them several times, this gown is for y\'all, not me. These circumstances don\'t require (or allow for) modesty. \\n\\nOnce on the table, they align my body with green lasers that come from the walls. In the initial session, they drew on my body to align where the lasers hit. In each subsequent session, that same alignment should be replicated. Where they drew on my me is covered with a sticker to keep the mark from wearing away. Currently my back looks a bit like a 3rd grade treasure map. \\n\\nThe techs tug on the sheets to move me and align the lasers to the marks. Once that\'s good, the leave the room and run the machine. My understanding is that the first few cycles take x-rays to make sure that my body is lined up as expected. They also check the size of my bladder - If the bladder isn\'t full enough, the machine will send radiation where you don\'t want it. The first session, one of the techs said my bladder was huge. Didn\'t want to ruin her day, but I had to tell her I was happily married. Today was the first time my bladder wasn\'t full enough, so they had to pull me off the machine and drink some water while they took the next patient. \\n\\nLast, they run the machine while I try to breath belly-down on a table while also staying absolutely still because there are copious levels of radiation beaming into my body. This thought invariably causes me to breath faster, and it all cycles back on itself into several anxious moments until the treatment is finished. Usually a total of less than 15 minutes.\\n\\nI haven\'t had any side effects that I can discern yet. I\'m not sure when those will come into play. There\'s a lot of energy hitting my colon/rectum, so that tissue can\'t be happy.

My engineering brain can\'t handle the fact that there must be something I could be doing - Doing right now, mind you, instead of this - that would increase the effectiveness of the radiation/decrease the severity of side effects.  \\n \\n \\nPort Placement: \\n \\nDone as of Tuesday AM. It was the most pleasant hour of my cancer journey so far, thanks to my nurse anesthetist. Chuck, you\'re my new favorite bartender. Maybe more on this later. \\n \\nSide effect is it looks like the port is a season ending basketball injury for me. I don\'t like the thought of an errant elbow sending me to the hospital. The area where they put the port under the skin is still bruised and tender. My jump shot was already pretty bad - With the right pec tender and me tentative, scoring would be way down. So, it\'s likely goodbye, Y - Hope to see you in fall of 2022. Missing it a lot already. \\n \\nIn other sports news, this morning was a hard for me - Missing the pickup soccer game that was a lifeline of competitive camaraderie throughout the pandemic. Currently working on a shield for the port so I can play AMA league pickup soccer. AMA is \'against medical advice\', for all us non-doctors. Luckily, my soccer skills are at a base level such that any decline will likely go unnoticed.\\n \\n \\nChemo: \\n \\nWednesday 12/29 to Wednesday 4/20, every 2 weeks - FOLFOX regimen, which is 2 hours of oxaliplatin at Duke, then take home some 5-FU in a pump that runs for about 46 hours. My mind isn\'t ready to process that length of schedule yet. Mine are used to me being irritable from December to April anyway, so perhaps it\'ll just be a wash.\\n \\n~Ed\\n\\nNote: I\'m mostly leaving Karen\'s treatment out of the updates, out of respect for her right to tell her story.

They explained what the plan was to treat my cancer. The plan was different than what I expected, but not excessively so. \\n \\nThe radonc wants to do a short course of radiation right away. This means 5 treatments over the course of 5 days. To do that, they first need to model my body and tumor a bit. So I\'m scheduled to go in Friday AM and have that done. \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e \\n\\nThe usual course of TNT treatment for rectal cancer is chemo then long course (4 weeks) radiation then more chemo, but Duke has to be different. The reason they\'re big on the short course up front is that 1) it seems to work, and 2) folks tend to do better at getting the whole chemo dose in if it isn\'t interrupted. \\n \\nOnce they get that done, there\'s about a week long process to get the plan in place so the correct radiation dose is sent to the right body tissue. With the dose and plan set, they run that dosing on the 5 million dollar machine, running the x-rays into some kind of crash test dummy. This serves to verify that the radiation program is aimed at the right spot, etc. Don\'t irradiate my lungs, please.\\n \\nOnce that\'s all validated, I go in for treatment. The radiation treatment only lasts for about 5 minutes, but the indignity of it should be lifelong. I\'ll be positioned ass-up on a table, with my butt cheeks spread apart with tape. I\'m not sure of the rest of the details yet. It\'s nice to have something to look forward to. \\n \\nSo 5 days of radiation in a row, then a week of rest, then start on the chemo. \\n \\nI got the choice of Xeloda (pills) or IV chemo. I\'ve preliminarily picked the IV chemo. That means every 2 weeks I go in, get a 2 hour infusion of a searing neurotoxin called oxaliplatin, and then leave with a pump that jams in the rest of the chemo over 48 hours or so. I believe they want me to do that for 9 cycles, which adds up to 18 weeks. Then a short break, then surgery. \\n \\nWhat we\'re hoping for (and this sometimes happens, but damn sure not all the time) is pCR - pathological complete response. That would mean that they do the surgery and send off the bits that are removed, and those bits appear to have no cancer. \\n \\nYou might think \'Well that would suck - Surgery for nothing\'. And yes, some folks/doctors are willing to take a wait and see approach if the chemo and radiation is particularly effective. The problem is that without pulling out the chunk and slicing it up, you\'ll never really know if they got it all. Or the way that you find out is when the cancer re-appears - Maybe in the same spot, maybe elsewhere.\\n \\nSo pCR is the best case scenario. Even under the best case, I\'ve still got 6 months of chemo treatments, plus 3+ months of surgical process ahead. Plus additional side effects, some of which will be long term or permanent. Also, 3 to 5 years of scanning just to make sure nothing else is cropping up. Best case. \\n \\nWorst case, you\'re reading this sometime in 2024 trying to figure out when exactly everything went to shit. Not yet. Skip ahead. \\n \\nI have not yet inquired on the odds of developing some form of superpower due to the radiation treatment. Bringing a spider \'just in case\' would likely strain the relationship between patient and radiation oncologist.  \\n \\nI\'m feeling OK physically. A bit stressed mentally, but still sane. They say people have good days and bad days, and that seems true. I\'m not thinking only about cancer all the time - Still enjoy the challenges of my work, and the company of friends and family. \\n \\nIt is mildly reassuring to have a plan. Then again, Iron Mike Tyson once said \'Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth\'. Maybe give the radonc one free shot before we start, just to get it out of the way. \\n \\nThanks for all the well wishes, comments, etc. I won\'t respond to each one, but they are appreciated. \\n\\n~Ed"},{"id":"clean-lungs","metadata":{"permalink":"/edsBlog/clean-lungs","source":"@site/edsBlog/2021-11-11-clean-lungs.md","title":"Clean Lungs","description":"Mini update30.

Go get a colonoscopy if you haven\'t already. \\n\\nAround July of 2021, I started noticing some blood in my stool. It started happening on a more regular basis, usually first thing in the morning. By August I saw a primary care physician for the sole purpose of getting a colonoscopy referral. The colonoscopy was scheduled for Oct 20th, which seemed like a long time to wait. I was able to convince someone at Duke to get me an earlier appointment, in late September. \\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e \\n\\nTake the prep, poop a lot of water, go get the procedure. Came to after the colonoscopy. Doc Crocker says there\'s a polyp too large for him to get that\'s the source of the bleeding. While still high on procedure drugs, I google up a doc in Duke\'s system that says he\'s got a special Japanese technique (ESD) for taking out large polyps. We wait on the biopsy, which comes back negative (i.e. not cancer). Seems like good news. Still, it has to come out.\\n\\nThe ESD doc (Dufault) says he can probably get it out. We have a great conversation about smoked brisket and how much I\'m going to maybe miss it. Then we talk about the ESD process. What\'s great about that is he can use a hole I have instead of making any new ones. Simple, outpatient procedure. It takes 2 weeks, but we finally get that scheduled for Oct. 28th.\\n\\nBig day comes. I go to get the 4 hour procedure, and get taken out of anesthesia after only about an hour. Doc says unfortunately procedure was not successful. Started doing some cutting, looked too ugly, stopped - Persistence, in this instance, would not have been virtuous. Woke me, broke me, got me a referral to a GI oncology surgeon - The one he\'d use in my shoes.\\n\\nOver the weekend, I\'m wisely advised to push on imaging ASAP so we can evaluate staging. Thanks, Jed. Call, email, pester, get my appointment changed so that ct scan precedes talking to the surgeon. \\n\\nWhich brings me to today, which I spent at Duke. First for a contrast ct scan. The contrast they inject thru an IV. I\'m a puker and a fainter when it comes to needles, blood and medicine. So I spent a few minutes white and sweaty while awaiting the ct. The fluid goes in, makes a metallic taste in the mouth and creates the sensation that I\'ve wet myself. Would not wait in line to ride that again. \\n\\nThen, off to see Dr. Migaly, a Duke GI oncology surgeon, for a 2PM appointment. I don\'t see his face until about 4PM. By about 5PM, I\'m on a table having various implements inserted into my rectum. First, a rigid scope to determine if we\'ll call this colon cancer or rectal cancer (a matter of cm one way or the other - this one is just on the rectal side of the line). Next, an ultrasound machine to try to evaluate how far the tumor goes and whether any lymph nodes look upset. Finally, a flexible scope (a relief, as it\'s the smallest of the 3) so they can jab at the lesion and take enough samples to biopsy and get a positive cancer result.  \\n\\nWatching a metal set of jaws jab into my colon on the camera while under no anesthesia. Feeling the tug as little chunks of my colon were removed. Trying to joke with nurses who are likely tired of this surgeon pulling shit like \'we still got that ultrasound machine?\' at 5PM. Moments I won\'t soon forget. \\n\\nPreliminary results of all this day\'s testing and prodding is that the tumor looks like it is a T3, which I think means it goes past the wall of the colon. There looks like there is at least a single lymph node that is enlarged, which makes it about an N1. No proven metastases outside the colon (although there is a spot on the liver that they\'re mildly concerned about). Hopefully that makes it M0. What do all these terms mean? Go ahead and google them if you want to drop down a deep well of cancer stats and studies. \\n\\nWhat it means for me is that, as of today, my likely course of treatment is:\\n\\n0) More tests. MRI for liver, MRI for colon (may have to wait due to clips in there left over from ESD). Tumor presented at tumor panel, which seems to be some \'Hall of Justice\' like meeting where all the Duke docs talk about what they\'d do with this thing. Hopefully a positive cancer diagnosis on today\'s biopsy so we can shake it in the face of any Duke admin looking for justification for my use of various procedures/equipment/aircraft.\\n\\n1) Some kind of chemo/radiation therapy to try to shrink the size of the tumor prior to operating on it. Side effects, while varied, seem uniformly unpleasant. I\'m already skinny and bald, so I got that going for me. \\n\\n2) Maybe 4-5 months from now - Surgery to pull a chunk out of my rectum/colon. Surgery that leaves me with a bag that the poop goes into until my rectum and colon have healed enough to be reunited.\\n\\nNote: There are multiple technical terms for this bag. Most of those terms end with -ostmy. Few of those terms are more clear and succinct than poop bag.\\n\\n3) Maybe 8 months from now - Surgery to get rid of the shit bag.\\n\\nIs this course of treatment a 100% accurate description? Probably not. It\'s a decent gist of what I was able to retain after a day of having things shoved up my ass. Plus what I\'ve been able to google in the interim. \\n\\nThat\'s it for now. Feel free to share, feel free to never look at this site again. I don\'t need everyone in my life all up in my ass (figuratively) - I\'m pretty sure I don\'t want to have these conversations multiple times daily. So most updates will probably go here. \\n\\nI\'ve got more to offer than just the sum of my ailments. \\n\\n~Ed"}]}}')}}]);
