He\u2019s got to find each hole in my small intestine (and there are at least 4). He\u2019ll then cut a little before the hole and a little after the hole and join the cut sections together. This joint is called an anastomosis. In theory, he\u2019ll have to do that 4 times. In practice, could be between 2 and 6.

Whether or not I\u2019ll have a bellybutton anymore is an open question - My ambivalence on the matter is boundless. Presence/absence of navel is not on my list of success metrics.
