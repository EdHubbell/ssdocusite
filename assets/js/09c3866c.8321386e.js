I check to make sure there's a picture of me on their computer - I don't want someone else's radiation.

Once that's good, the leave the room and run the machine. My understanding is that the first few cycles take x-rays to make sure that my body is lined up as expected. They also check the size of my bladder - If the bladder isn't full enough, the machine will send radiation where you don't want it. The first session, one of the techs said my bladder was huge. Didn't want to ruin her day, but I had to tell her I was happily married.
