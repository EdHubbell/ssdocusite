The reason they're big on the short course up front is that 1) it seems to work, and 2) folks tend to do better at getting the whole chemo dose in if it isn't interrupted."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Once they get that done, there's about a week long process to get the plan in place so the correct radiation dose is sent to the right body tissue. With the dose and plan set, they run that dosing on the 5 million dollar machine, running the x-rays into some kind of crash test dummy. This serves to verify that the radiation program is aimed at the right spot, etc. Don't irradiate my lungs, please."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Once that's all validated, I go in for treatment. The radiation treatment only lasts for about 5 minutes, but the indignity of it should be lifelong. I'll be positioned ass-up on a table, with my butt cheeks spread apart with tape. I'm not sure of the rest of the details yet.

I've preliminarily picked the IV chemo. That means every 2 weeks I go in, get a 2 hour infusion of a searing neurotoxin called oxaliplatin, and then leave with a pump that jams in the rest of the chemo over 48 hours or so. I believe they want me to do that for 9 cycles, which adds up to 18 weeks. Then a short break, then surgery."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"What we're hoping for (and this sometimes happens, but damn sure not all the time) is pCR - pathological complete response. That would mean that they do the surgery and send off the bits that are removed, and those bits appear to have no cancer."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"You might think 'Well that would suck - Surgery for nothing'. And yes, some folks/doctors are willing to take a wait and see approach if the chemo and radiation is particularly effective. The problem is that without pulling out the chunk and slicing it up, you'll never really know if they got it all. Or the way that you find out is when the cancer re-appears - Maybe in the same spot, maybe elsewhere."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"So pCR is the best case scenario. Even under the best case, I've still got 6 months of chemo treatments, plus 3+ months of surgical process ahead. Plus additional side effects, some of which will be long term or permanent. Also, 3 to 5 years of scanning just to make sure nothing else is cropping up. Best case."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Worst case, you're reading this sometime in 2024 trying to figure out when exactly everything went to shit. Not yet.
