The point of the vacuum system is to suck out any liquid leaking from the bowels. Evidently there are 2 damaged areas that were likely nicked when I had the procedure to move the ostomy from right to left (the same surgery this wound is from). I'm on complete bowel rest. They want nothing going thru there. The drier and less active that area is, the better chance it has to heal.

Karen and I are being trained on TPN (total parenteral nutrition) - It's a bag of fluid that one of my children called my 'cum bag'. Save your criticism.

It's hard to get into any books. I stare at the clock on the wall a lot. The minute hand moves every 15 seconds, which means it must have about 240 gear teeth on it.

I had no positive lymph nodes, which is a big deal because cancer spread usually happens thru the lymphatic system.
