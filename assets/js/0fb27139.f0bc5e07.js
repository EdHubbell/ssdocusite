During the visit for my 6th treatment, I told them I had decided to discontinue the oxaliplatin portion of chemo (which is the chemical with the most challenging short- and long-term effects). During that appointment, the oncologist suggested that we could do just 8 treatments instead of 9. \u2018Eight, nine, it\u2019s arbitrary\u2019. Seemed odd to me.

This is mostly the result of healing of the radiation proctitis (injury to the rectal area due to the radiation treatment) and a hemorrhoid that ceased thrombosing (de-thrombosed?). My daily pain level is much lower. Sleeping 3 hours at a stretch is no longer rare. I\u2019m able to get out of the house some, and my bowel control is much better than it was. It\u2019s still bad enough that I crapped myself in the plumbing aisle at Home Depot \u2013 But the fact that I felt good enough to try to get out of the house (or consider plumbing) is an improvement.

Once we get the scans scheduled and done, we\u2019ll know more about the state of the tumor. The goal of the radiation and chemo treatments that I\u2019ve been through is that the tumor will be smaller (or even gone). Hopefully the scans that I\u2019ll go thru will allow us to downstage the tumor \u2013 So instead of a T3, maybe it\u2019ll be a T1 or T0.

I\u2019m part of some colorectal cancer groups on FB, and they don\u2019t always provide much comfort. Still, there are many factors in my favor. My CEA numbers were low during my initial treatment, and my residual tumor DNA test (Signatera) came back negative early in my chemo cycles.
