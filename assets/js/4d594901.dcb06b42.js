It started happening on a more regular basis, usually first thing in the morning. By August I saw a primary care physician for the sole purpose of getting a colonoscopy referral.

I was able to convince someone at Duke to get me an earlier appointment, in late September."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Take the prep, poop a lot of water, go get the procedure. Came to after the colonoscopy. Doc Crocker says there's a polyp too large for him to get that's the source of the bleeding.

We wait on the biopsy, which comes back negative (i.e. not cancer). Seems like good news. Still, it has to come out."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The ESD doc (Dufault) says he can probably get it out. We have a great conversation about smoked brisket and how much I'm going to maybe miss it. Then we talk about the ESD process.

First for a contrast ct scan. The contrast they inject thru an IV. I'm a puker and a fainter when it comes to needles, blood and medicine.

By about 5PM, I'm on a table having various implements inserted into my rectum. First, a rigid scope to determine if we'll call this colon cancer or rectal cancer (a matter of cm one way or the other - this one is just on the rectal side of the line). Next, an ultrasound machine to try to evaluate how far the tumor goes and whether any lymph nodes look upset. Finally, a flexible scope (a relief, as it's the smallest of the 3) so they can jab at the lesion and take enough samples to biopsy and get a positive cancer result."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Watching a metal set of jaws jab into my colon on the camera while under no anesthesia.

Moments I won't soon forget."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Preliminary results of all this day's testing and prodding is that the tumor looks like it is a T3, which I think means it goes past the wall of the colon. There looks like there is at least a single lymph node that is enlarged, which makes it about an N1. No proven metastases outside the colon (although there is a spot on the liver that they're mildly concerned about). Hopefully that makes it M0. What do all these terms mean?
