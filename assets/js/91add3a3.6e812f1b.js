First off, if they are paying $30 a month to host this site, they are paying about $25 too much. I'm not saying that you should not donate to CaringBridge - It's a great central (and free) spot to allow patients to communicate with loved ones. However, it seems like some folks have donated with the expectation that some portion of that donation benefits me directly (We're looking at you, user Treat Yo Self). The language that CaringBridge uses doesn't attempt to correct that impression.

That connection needs time to heal - So I'll have an ileostomy (hole in the abdomen that connects to the small intestine) for about 3 months. At least 90 days of a poop bag and modified diet. Then back in for another procedure to reverse the ileostomy and try out the repaired bunghole. All of this is best-case scenario."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"They use a robot, so (barring complications) the incisions should be small.
