There are some really quaint cancer treatment guidelines that say if you are experiencing 7 or more bowel movements over your standard, that qualifies you as a grade 3 toxicity, and that maybe hospitalization should be considered. Showing big cards (like 40 bms in 24 hours, or 8mg over the daily max dose of Imodium) got the table's attention. Bringing a lucid exhausted incontinent patient in for a hydration IV wasn't anyone's idea of a good morning. Having a physician on hand to tell them that I wasn't really all that dehydrated probably helped. Karen brought in a stool sample that tested negative for c-diff. Then they were able to write a script for some diphenoxylate-atropine, which Karen was able to pick up for me.

I contend that any medication that cuts toilet trips by twenty in 24 hours will be habit forming. Since Monday, I've had 2 nights of actual sleep. Dreamt of a Muppet too heavy to defenestrate.

I'm tired, because spending 6 hours at a cancer center takes a lot out of me. It is at least as bad as going to the dentist. Plus, Karen is sitting next to me after going thru her 2nd of 5 radiation treatments, so the couch cancer quotient is maximized.
