# StomaStrap customization

The first StomaStrap designs were tested using [ConvaTec Sur-Fit Natura 1-3/4" 411802](https://www.google.com/search?q=convatec+sur+fit+natura+411802) wafer. A split wafer support ring for Hollister 57mm wafers has also been developed.

We're very interested in working with users of other wafers, or even one piece systems. Contact us at [sales@stomastrap.com](mailto:sales@stomastrap.com) or call us at [(919) 656-3926](tel:9196563926) and we'll see what we can do to help. 

StomaStrap parts are custom 3D printed for each order. This manufacturing method makes it easy to change parameters to suit different users. For example, we can print taller standoffs for users with larger stomas. Our goal is to supply a custom fit device that fits your specific needs. As we grow, we will invest in the software and hardware capabilities to allow for greater customization.

The designer of the StomaStrap system has worn one every day for over a year.
