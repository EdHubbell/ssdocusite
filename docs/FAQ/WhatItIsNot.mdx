# What StomaStrap Is Not

There are a lot of products for ostomates. Some products are from huge muti-national corporations.
Other products are from much smaller organizations, often started by ostomates. Most of these products 
solve real problems, and we've got several of them in our arsenal.

Every ostomate is different, so some of these products might be just what you need.


## Not For Hiding a Stoma

There are lots of products available to cover a stoma. Ostomates have a wealth of reasons for hiding a stoma. 
Personally, having a bag flapping off my abdomen causes me no end of intimacy issues. 

One good option for hiding a stoma under your clothing is [StealthBelt](https://stealthbelt.org/) - I've got the 
sideways model. It mostly stays in my bedside drawer, but it's nice to have when I need it. 

There are also cheaper belt models made by [WearWan](https://www.wearwans.com/) on Amazon - I've got a couple of these that I 
keep around. Easy to get delivered quickly, and lots of color options. 


## Not For Out-of-Beltline Hernia Support 

StomaStrap can support a peristomal hernia that is in-line with the belt. 
If you need more all-encompassing hernia support, you'll probably want something wider. 

Coloplast makes the [Brava Ostomsy Support Belt](https://products.coloplast.us/coloplast/ostomy-care/brava/belt/brava-ostomy-support-belt/?srsltid=AfmBOorbPyeHnUr4t4MOt3__KxCShwNSafeLwgk7y-HWdJxvNVRi5wyt) 
- That may work for you. The pocket to jam your hand in to stretch the belt in is a nice design element. 

I found the support on the Brava to be pretty weak overall. My peristomal hernia was barely compressed when wearing it. It is also a pain to put on - Feeding the bag through the 
hole in the belt can be awkward because of how big the belt is. Pretty good design overall, tho.

There's also models from [Nu-Hope](https://nu-hope.com/) - Although there's little chance that my stoma prolapses will be stopped by a velcro strap.
