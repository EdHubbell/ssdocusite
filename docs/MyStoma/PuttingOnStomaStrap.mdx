# Putting On the StomaStrap

Here's how I wear my StomaStrap


:::danger
These are less graphic images, but still show a stoma wafer and maybe some navy boxer-briefs. The images are hidden by default, but will show if you click on the <ImageOnClick imageUrl="/img/spoiler/Rickroll.jpg" altText="RickRoll" buttonName="🔍"/>

### Base and Ring Over Bag <ImageOnClick imageUrl="/img/spoiler/250324/07_BaseAndRingOverBag.jpg" altText="BaseAndRingOverBag" buttonName="🔍"/>

Pull the bag thru the StomaStrap wafer support ring and base. The stiff wafer support ring (orange) should sit against the wafer - It applies down-force on the wafer adhesive.

Here, you can really see that parastomal hernia on my left hand side. The belt support will serve to squash that down shortly.

### Belt to Base <ImageOnClick imageUrl="/img/spoiler/250324/08_BeltToBase.jpg" altText="BeltToBase" buttonName="🔍"/>

The StomaStrap belt span stays on the belt and inserts into slots on the base. Supports on the base keep the belt from exerting too much force down on the stoma.

The first designs that I used had huge supports to avoid compressing the stoma at all. They aren't really needed for my stoma. It functions fine while somewhat squished. 
We can design higher supports if that's needed.

### Belt Tighten <ImageOnClick imageUrl="/img/spoiler/250324/09_BeltTighten.jpg" altText="BeltTighten" buttonName="🔍"/>

Tighten the belt around the torso. The belt compresses the wafer to the user's skin.

If it feels too tight, it is too tight.

You can see here that the parastomal hernia is supported (aka squashed down) by the belt and support base.

### Ready to Roll <ImageOnClick imageUrl="/img/spoiler/250324/10_ReadyToRoll.jpg" altText="ReadyToRoll" buttonName="🔍"/>

We're done - This is what it looks like to wear a StomaStrap. The StomaStrap compresses the wafer, protects the stoma, and supports any hernias that are in-line with the system.

The StomaStrap is not designed to hide your stoma. There are better alternatives if that is the goal. 

The StomaStrap is designed to keep ostomates active and secure.

### Under a T-Shirt <ImageOnClick imageUrl="/img/spoiler/250324/11_UnderATshirt.jpg" altText="UnderATshirt" buttonName="🔍"/>

The StomaStrap can hide well under a shirt. Especially a wrinkled one.

Yes, if you're looking for it, you can tell something is under the shirt.
