# What is a StomaStrap?

Let's introduce StomaStrap and find out if it's the right ostomy appliance support system for you.

 If you have a stoma, or help someone who has one, **StomaStrap might be for you.**

## The Basics

StomaStrap is a device that attaches to an ostomy appliance and adds additional support. It's stronger than a typical ostomy belt. 
StomaStrap can also help provide support for a [parastomal hernia](https://www.google.com/search?q=parastomal+hernia). 
It can also help to prevent or contain a [prolapsed stoma](https://www.google.com/search?q=parastomal+hernia).

### StomaStrap parts

The StomaStrap system consists of 4 distinct parts:

<ModelViewer modelPath="/models/StomaStrap_FullAssyConvaTec45mm.glb" />

* Wafer Support Ring (orange)- A stiff plastic piece custom designed to fit different wafer designs. When assembled, the ring presses down on the wafer, securing it to the user. Users  select the wafer support ring that matches the wafer part number they currently use. Wafer support rings curve somewhat to match the wearer, while also compressing the body near the stoma to match the wafer.

* Support Base (navy) - A flexible plastic piece that holds the wafer ring tight against the user. It has standoffs to prevent the belt from applying downward pressure directly on the stoma. 
The support base can be used with different wafer support rings, so users can change wafers and still use the same StomaStrap base, belt span, and belt.

* Belt Span (pink) - This is a flexible plastic piece that attaches the belt to the support base. It has standoffs that insert into the support base, and guide loops to run the belt through. 

* Belt (not shown) - This is provided by the user. Any standard 1.5" belt should work - Users have found [canvas D-ring belts](https://www.google.com/search?q=1.5"+canvas+d-ring+belt) to be comfortable for daily use.
