5/5 radiation treatments done. I was told to expect side delayed side effects such as fatigue and diarrhea, along with additional GI distress. I've pretty much ducked any of those consequences to this point - All I really have are calf cramps. Hopefully that continues. It makes me wonder if the damn radiation machine was even on.

I felt well enough to play soccer this morning, and I'm getting used to the port. I didn't score, missed an early great scoring opportunity, and took several shots that were not nearly on goal. A typical performance all around. Plus 2 hours of cardio for the first time in weeks.
 
Feeling good about my treatments so far. Looking forward to a nice Christmas with family. Then chemo starts on the 29th. Merry Christmas and happy holidays to you and your loved ones!
