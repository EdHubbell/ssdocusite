Just a note from Duke ER (where I'm ensconced due to a blood infection). Looks like Monday's long awaited surgery will be still longer awaited. I'm on IV antibiotics. They've pulled my PICC line, which means I'm going with no TPN (nutrition) for the next few days. Hopefully I'll have news later on surgery reschedule date. Until then, I wait.

It was satisfying to leave the ER AMA (against medical advice) after 7 hours without treatment or fluids. They even made me sign something that threatened to put this episode on my permanent record. Returning at midnight was the way to go. Had a room within 30 minutes. Try to schedule your emergencies towards the early AM hours. 

On the phone, so not going to write much more now. I'm feeling ok, and should be back to not eating in no time.
