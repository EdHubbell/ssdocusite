After~400 days of TPN and not eating, surgery day is here. Again. Looks like it'll happen.

In pre-op bed, ready to get this day started. Should start at 7:20AM and last until ? - They said 8 to 14 hours or so. I think they're doing the water pump while they're in there.

I don't have much to add at this time. I've showered and shown up, and plan to lay very still. Everything else isn't up to me. 

Looking forward to counting backwards. Then I'll wake up at if no time had passed, and get the news on how things went.
