Friday's 2 hour procedure stretched to 9 full hours. By the end, my bowels were so swollen that they could not fit them back in the body cavity. So I'm technically still open. They're going to close me up on Monday. 
 
They really think it wasn't going to ever work the way it was, and they think it will work the way it is now. Sounds familiar.

I've got the NG tube back again, this time in the right nostril (for fun). It was inserted while I was awake. They inserted it after they deintubated me. Also while awake. I wish none of this on any of you. 
 
I'm back in the ICU, which feels a whole lot like square one. Probably won't get out until at least Tuesday, as the king's horses and men aren't due until Monday. 
 
After I get out of the ICU, it's back to waiting for the bowel to start. And for all these new cuts to heal, ivs to disappear, drains to stop, annoyances to fade. Just a lot more waiting, for exactly the same things I was waiting for 2 weeks ago. 
 
For now I'm going to go back to sleep at 3:30 on a sunny Saturday afternoon. That passes time.
