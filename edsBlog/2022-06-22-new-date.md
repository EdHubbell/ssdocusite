New surgery date is July 15th, so a three week delay. Happy it isn't four, sad it isn't two. Given the circumstances, about the best I could reasonably hope for. 
 
Regarding my circumstances: I tire of them. Yet I know several battling cancer who'd trade me on the spot. Offers perspective, but nothing close to joy. 
 
Cutting this short. Need to regain a sense of humor before casting shadows on summer. I'll be OK, just need a day.

Hug your kids/loved ones/etc. 
 
(Don't hug mine - They've all been exposed to COVID)
