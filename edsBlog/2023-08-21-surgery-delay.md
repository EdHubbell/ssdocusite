>Dr. Migaly wanted to offer you the soonest available surgery date he, the plastics, and urology teams had available for your multi-provider surgery. That date is 10/5/23. Please let me know if this date works for your schedule 

Over the past year, since August 2022, my schedule consists of precisely one entry: Await fistula takedown surgery. I don't go out west for Christmas, or Iceland for spring break. No travel to Asia for work. I put TPN into my veins for 12 hours a day, and I wait. 

<!-- truncate --> 

So Oct 5th works. Any day before I die works. 

But what you're offering - It's a scheduling shit sandwich. I know why it's at my table, and that I'm going to have to eat it. I don't want to hear about how you made it, or about how lucky I am to have it. I'm in no place to hear those things. 

So Oct 5th it is. I don't want to talk about it. Just putting my head back down and doing my time.
