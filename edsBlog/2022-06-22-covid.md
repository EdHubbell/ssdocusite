There is a pre-surgery COVID screening test. I took it Tuesday AM. Results came back at 10:30PM - COVID positive. Hence my Thursday surgery is delayed. 
 
It's an 8 hour procedure, so it's not the easiest thing to slip into someone's calendar. Especially when that someone is a highly qualified and scheduled surgeon. They are working on a new date. I'll put another post up once I know more.

It's all very disappointing. I am feeling mostly OK, just a slight runny nose. More pain from sleeping on the floor of our office than from actual COVID.
 
That's about all I have to share at this time.
