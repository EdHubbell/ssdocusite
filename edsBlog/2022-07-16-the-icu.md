I'm in the ICU. Things have not gone according to plan. The robotic surgery had to transition to open surgery 2 hours in. That initial 8 hour surgery failed, so they had to go in for another 6 hours. 

I've been given a permanent colostomy bag. So I've likely farted for the last time. 

On the plus side, they think they got all the cancer out.

Dunno how long I'll be in the hospital for. Hoping to make it out of the ICU today. One step at a time. 

That's it for now. Fingers are asleep, so I can't text much. I'll type up a more juicy take later.
