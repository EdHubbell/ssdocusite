Surgery, by all accounts, went well. 12 hours, didn't lose much bowel, and they were asked to completely close my previously open abdomen. I'm feeling great about that.

Current status is resting uncomfortably in room 21016 at the main Duke hospital. Every hiccup and burp and gurgle hurts. Happy to have them, tho. It's been a year since the last ones. 

That's about all I can type now. Turning the  phone back off and trying to rest. My love to you all
