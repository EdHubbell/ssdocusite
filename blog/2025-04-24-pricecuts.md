We're cutting our prices. I could say that we've received feedback that our
pricing is too high. This feedback has come in the form of only one sale of a StomaStrap system. 

I do know that the customer for that first system is quite satisfied.

As you've probably already guessed, that first customer is me. I had to order a system just to make sure that the Shopify store even works. Plus I needed to make sure I can actually print a shipping label, etc. All those details are now squared away. 

So as of 4/24/25, you can still be customer #1. It'll just be order #2. And full systems are now $40, down from $70.

Next steps are to work on some marketing. Maybe a video of my youngest throwing a soccer ball right at my StomaStrap. Plus maybe some product improvements.
