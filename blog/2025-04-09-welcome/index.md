We're going to try and get some StomaStrap devices out to ostomates. It's going to take some effort.

I developed the StomaStrap to suit my needs. 

And honestly, if no one else needs to use one, that's great. I've got other things to spend my time on. 

Here's me in a shirt, wearing a StomaStrap. You can see it, but barely.

And here it is on. Probably need a better photo than that, but this is a start.
