I stopped paying Shopify after the 3 month trial ran out. The only StomaStrap I sold was to myself (to make sure the shipping labels and payment would work).

Still wear my StomaStrap every day, still getting 1 week wear time most weeks. But I've got clients I need to do engineering work for, and this side project 
hasn't bourne much fruit.

Still, it's something. Doing something is better than nothing. So there's that. 

Feel free to ping me if you think a StomaStrap would work for you. I can send you the files to have some nice kid at the library print them out from their 
3D printers. Or maybe I'll be your new friend and do that for you.
